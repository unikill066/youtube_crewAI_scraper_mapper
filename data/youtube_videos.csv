https://www.instagram.com/42restaurant/",2025-03-17T17:00:02Z,"['https://the-attention-game.com', 'https://www.instagram.com/alexandertheguest', 'https://www.instagram.com/42restaurant/']",aRHpvU3dNn4,"Three Michelin stars are the 
biggest award in gastronomy. Some restaurants work for decades to earn   Michelin stars, while others 
earn them in just a few months. The restaurant we’re visiting today is one   of the few that did it winning three 
stars just six months after opening. So many people told me that 
this restaurant is a must-visit. So here I am, and now, I’m taking 
you with me to JAN by Jan Hartwig. Welcome to Munich. A city of tradition and progress. Home to the legendary football club, to BMW, and 
to a festival that turns beer into a way of life. Oktoberfest. The world’s largest and most iconic beer festival. Imagine massive tents overflowing with 
music, laughter, and endless mugs of beer. It’s been a Munich tradition for over 200 years. But today, we’re skipping the beer and pretzels, 
because we are heading to the city center,  Near Königsplatz. At first glance, this place 
didn’t seem too inviting. But the moment I stepped 
inside, everything changed. Nordic minimalism, great atmosphere, 
and beautiful burnt oak tabletops. The kitchen is partially open, or as 
they call it, the Laboratory of Love. The moment I settled in, the 
chef had already set the stage. He sent us a glass of Krug as a welcome drink. It’s a really kind gesture. I appreciate it. They operate with one menu, but for an 
extra charge, we can add signature courses. I’ve heard nothing but praise about the 
signatures, so skipping them isn’t an option. The menu comes in at 340 euros, 
with the wine pairing at 189 euros. Their wine list is a bit on the modest side, 
but when it comes to Krug, they’re well-stocked. We skipped the wine pairing 
and preferred to freestyle. I have to say, I’m really curious. Everyone I’ve talked to says 
this place is fantastic. And we won’t have to wait long to find 
out, because the first bites are here! First up is JAN’s signature 
snack, on the menu since day one. It’s whipped foie gras mousse, paired with 
smoked maple syrup, and roasted pecan nuts. The balance is incredible. Cold, sweet, and perfectly harmonious, with 
the pecans adding just the right crunch. Next up is the Crustade. A bite of char belly with pistachio, 
wasabi, soy tapioca, and mayo. This one is all about discovery. Every bite is like a little explosion of flavor. I ate it slowly, letting my brain catch 
up with everything happening on my palate. And then, the Carne Cruda. It comes with a lightly whipped bonito cream. It was great, but it felt like 
the weakest link of the trio. Coming up, we have a dish inspired by 
the traditional “Hamburger Aalsuppe”. Which back in the days was served 
as a main meal for poor people. But here It’s a small stew 
with bone marrow dumplings,   root vegetables, prunes, and smoked eel. I love how they transformed a traditional 
dish into something so refined. Delicious and satisfying. We asked the sommelier to surprise 
us with something something special. and here she is with a 2020 Pulvermächer Riesling. At first, it’s a nice, elegant wine, 
but for me, it feels a bit slow. Arriving next is a dish called Quail Egg. It’s a blend of poached quail 
egg, jellified Serrano ham broth,   corn glazed with smoked butter, 
Parmesan espuma, and chives. The sweetness of the corn really comes through,   meanwhile, the broth adds 
a beautiful umami flavor. and I especially enjoy the crunch in each bite. Another wine arrives. It’s a 2011 Kirchenstück 
GG, and the sommelier says   it will pair fantastically with our next dish. But the food doesn’t arrive right away. We ordered two different 
dishes from the signature menu,   which seems to have caused a 
slight delay in the kitchen. 15 minutes passed, and it felt even longer without 
any background music to liven up the atmosphere. But now, they’re finally here. The first is the Pâté en Croûte, 
a classical French masterpiece. Made with pork, foie gras, black truffle, and 
it’s topped with Madeira jelly and pistachios. On the side we have mesclun salad 
with croûtons and crispy chicken skin,   along with pickled radish 
and a homemade Dijonnaise. Every element is exceptional. It turns out ordering both dishes was a great   decision because the other one 
is even better than the pâté. Chef Jan created this sea urchin 
dish when his daughter was born. It’s deeply personal, representing complexity, 
strength, and fragility all at once. It’s Sea urchin paired with N25 Kaluga caviar,   jellified oxtail essence, and a finishing 
touch of chive oil and shiso flowers. The balance is stunning, with just 
the right touch of beautiful acidity. Two absolute showstoppers. They’re the reason I come to places like this. At this point, it feels only right to 
meet the mastermind behind this food. Jan Hartwig’s journey began at just four, 
slicing tomatoes beside his chef father. After high school, he studied 
hotel management and culinary arts. His journey took him through prestigious 
restaurants in Germany and Austria, including  Restaurant Aqua, Vendôme, and Restaurant Rosin. He led Atelier at Hotel Bayerischer Hof, earning 
not one, but three Michelin stars by 2017. But Hartwig wasn't done. In October 2022, he opened 
JAN in the heart of Munich. and within just six months, the 
restaurant achieved the ultimate honor. three Michelin stars, setting 
a new record at those times Somehow, October always seems 
to bring good fortune in Munich. Next on the table we have the Char from a 
local fishery topped with its own caviar, and  paired with kohlrabi purée. On the side is a fennel salad. The dish was completed with two sauces. A citrus vinaigrette and a fennel beurre blanc. Beautiful flavors. I liked it, but for me, it 
needed just a bit more punch to truly stand out. Even the wine pairing didn’t elevate 
it to the level I was hoping for. The next course is going 
to be Chef Jan’s signature. It’s called Pike Dumpling 2.0. The chef had a pike dumpling dish before opening 
the restaurant and this is an upgraded version. Silky pike and scallop dumpling 
filled with marigold oil,   paired with brined mackerel, nori 
marmalade, and a beurre blanc. The quality of the fish is superb, and the 
sauce delivers bold and concentrated flavors. A bread course is next. We start with homemade sourdough bread, 
with unsalted organic sour cream butter. Alongside is a spread inspired by a 
traditional North-West German winter dish. It combined curd cheese with 
kale, smoked onion purée,   potato, green spelt, and crispy kale and bacon. Just as we start eating, the sommelier 
arrives with a sparkling wine from Mosel. Not the ideal timing, to be honest. I'm super happy that I can 
try something from Germany. Although the sparkling wine is 
a bit short, sweet and mineral. What can I say after the Krug we had? I still prefer champagne. But the bread and butter were excellent. I really enjoyed the texture of the butter. The journey continues with Brill from Vendée. Wrapped in daikon, with a sauce of rich 
fish stock, and smoked crème fraîche. This dish started off quite slow,   but then the horseradish kicked in 
and took it to a whole new level. It's amazing how something as strong 
as horseradish has been made so gentle. When you soften an intense flavor, preserving 
it’s character without overpowering anything. It was just there enough to make 
the dish incredibly exciting. This is real magic. Between courses, the chef 
sent over an other surprise. A 1994 Corton-Charlemagne Grand 
Cru from Bonneau du Martray. A 30-year-old Burgundy Insane. It seems like the chef can read my mind. Thanks again, chef. Before the next course, the sommelier 
brings us a 2014 Pinot Noir,   a red that perfectly prepares 
the palate for what follows. Which is a completely unexpected dish. Glaced Sweetbread, inspired by goulash. Sweetbread, sauerkraut foam, 
gherkin salad, rich goulash stock. This is something truly special. I’ve never had anything like it before, and 
I know I’ll remember it for a long time. It feels like goulash at its core, but 
with the beef changed for sweetbread. And it works. I’m all in on this dish. A dish that lingers in my memory, especially 
because goulash is part of my DNA. After the goulash, we asked for an 
Armand Rousseau Premier Cru 2011. Then the sommelier came out and mentioned 
there was exactly just this small bottle left. So we didn’t hesitate. A true Burgundy masterpiece. And to return a favor, we share it with the chef. This will be the pairing for our next two courses. The first one is the roasted duck. With a touch of smoked butter 
and their custom duck spice. Paired with foie gras, pickled iceberg 
lettuce, and a vibrant blood orange. The flavors are deep, and the beetroot and 
blood orange worked beautifully together. A well-executed classic course. The next main course isn’t part of the set menu, 
we pick this one from the signature selections. I can't wait to try it. Made with fillet from the 
traditional South Tyrol breed,   topped with mushroom duxelles, 
and coated in cabbage and pastry. It’s baked whole, then cut in half. Served with Albufera sauce, black truffle sauce Executed to perfection without 
being reimagined or overcomplicated. I do appreciate that here, 
they kept it true to its roots. And that’s what makes it so special. An incredibly high-quality Beef 
Wellington, done just right. A beautiful finale to the main courses. Usually, this is the moment when 
the cheese trolley rolls in. But instead of a trolley, we get a cheese dish. It’s a 30-month-aged cheese from the 
Alps, served with pickled kohlrabi,   bitter salads, cranberries, 
and crispy chicken skin. It’s a nice dish. Our first dessert is right here. Christ Pear sorbet, Dulcey chocolate mousse, 
rosehip sauce, and rum-soaked raisins. It looks great and it is. The chef came out for a chat and 
shared a few personal stories with us. He introduces the next dessert himself, 
taking us back to his childhood. A classic German dessert made with rice slowly 
cooked in milk, finished with cinnamon and sugar. He recreated it, serving it cold with a twist 
of Kaffir lime zest and banana sorbet, orange  fillets, and a vibrant sauce of tropical fruits There was a similar dish in my childhood as 
well, so it brought a nice sense of nostalgia. I really enjoyed it. And finally, the Petit Fours 
a sweet ending to the journey. Whisky sour pâte de fruit with yuzu,warm 
madeleines served with cherry blossom cream,  and a milk chocolate bonbon 
made with 50% Madagascar cocoa. Our total for today is 2517 euro for two. I arrived at this restaurant with big excitement, 
because everyone told me, it will be fantastic. In most ways, it lived up to the expectation, 
but a few things came to my mind. Considering the number of guest, I think 
the service team need an extra hand. They didnt always have the 
capacity for everything,   and sometimes the timing slipped a little. But hats off to them for handling the 
service so well with such a small team. I think a truly experienced general 
manager overseeing everything,   someone who could guide the team would be helpful. I really enjoyed the menu and 
I was glad we had the chance   to try some classic signature dishes as well. It's exciting when someone handles 
flavors with such sensitivity. most of the people label German 
cuisine not that exciting, but somehow Jan the wizard, 
made german cuisine sexy. If I lived in Munich, I’d 
probably be a regular guest. But even though I don’t live 
there, I think I’ll come back. I wish them all the best in the future. Let’s take a short break to 
talk about something important. Important not just for me, but for You too! I get dozens of messages to 
check ‘this or that’ restaurant. Well, this is the time when I’m gonna nod to that. That’s why we created The Attention Game! If you have a restaurant and

I Tried the Restaurant of Italy’s MOST MICHELIN-STARRED Chef",2025-02-23T17:00:27Z,"['https://the-attention-game.com/', 'https://www.instagram.com/alexandertheguest', 'https://www.instagram.com/42restaurant/']",IfPptGgk7mE,"Today, I’m taking you to the flagship restaurant 
of the most Michelin-starred chef in all of Italy. He holds a total of 12 Michelin stars. The restaurant we’re visiting 
is located right here in Milan. And this is the only three-Michelin-starred 
restaurant in the city. Enrico Bartolini al Mudec. We are here at the Ansaldo complex. A former industrial park. Built in the early 1900’s, it was 
home to the metalworking industry. But by the 70’s, the site was mostly abandoned. The city eventually stepped in, 
reclaimed it, and transformed it. On the outside, it’s still 
a monster of functionality. Step inside, and look. Art and beauty take over. The biggest part of the complex is MUDEC. which is a contemporary cultural and art museum. We enter and take the elevator to the top floor. Warm welcomes all around, and because we are 
a bit early for lunch, we wait in the lounge. At every turn, they remind you 
that you are inside a museum. While we are waiting, we check out some books. And get some solid life advice. “Someday I will make the onions cry” Hard work, revenge and humor - I love it! A moment later, we are shown to the table. Everything is top quality, especially the linens. I wish you could feel this napkin. Gorgeous.  I've been to this restaurant twice 
before, but it’s been a while Which makes it a great excuse 
to come back and show it to you.  While the chef prepares our welcome appetisers,   we have some crusco pepper 
breadsticks as a little snack. And from the champagne 
trolley, the choice is clear. It’s gotta be the Krug Grand Cuvée. As a classical guitar version of 
“Can You Feel the Love Tonight”   plays softly in the background, 
our welcome appetisers are served. We have roasted eggplant, eggplant marinated with 
red shiso and langoustine and on the top caviar. With a sauce of lightly smoked grapefruit juice. On the column is a snail playing 
hide and seek inside a crust of   fried chickpeas with mushroom herbs on top. Then, a salad made with cuka melon 
and green tomato with raw shrimp. Onion chips with cherry and santolina emulsion. I have to say that despite the quote, 
we didn't manage to make this onion cry. And finally, a taco stuffed with king crab 
and horseradish mayo with seasonal herbs. So much goodness in one place. All of them were beautiful, 
but my favorite was the salad. Here, we meet Elia Gallo, 
the 23-year old Chef de Rang. He is team leader for the 
younger members of the staff. Despite their fresh faces, the team is very 
precise, humble, and, of course, professional. It’s the reconstruction of an Italian classic. But instead of chocolate, 
inside is raw Piedmont beef   with foie gras covered in edible 
leaf made from gold and hazelnut. I felt a bit like Harry Potter on his 
first trip on the Hogwarts Express   when he tried Bertie Bott's Every 
Flavour Beans for the first time. Sommelier Edoardo Jobet presents 
the wine list and the pairings. Judging by the size of the list, 
the wine cellar must be huge. The style of this book is young and 
fresh and follows the art theme.
   Everything is hand drawn. It’s a nice touch. For pairings they have two choices. I go for the unforgettables for 850 euros. Presenting the menu is Edgardo Guarino If we are pressed for time, we can 
do à la carte or business lunch menu. Otherwise, the best experience is the 
tasting menu called Experience MUDEC. It’s 10 courses for 375 euro. I love Italian fine dining, so this is 
the experience I’m looking forward to. Bread is next, made with spelt and white flour. And the purple color is achieved with beetroot. Listen to the sound of it. With the bread, we have French 
butter infused with tangerine peels. Really nice. Our first in the unforgettable wine 
pairing is a vintage selection by   legendary Italian producers The Bucci Family.
  The first taste of the MUDEC Experience 
is called the King of Tomato. It starts with “Cuore di bue” 
tomato, marinated in liquorice. Then it’s stuffed with tomato tartar, 
roasted almond, savory tonka bean ice cream. On top is a crusco pepper. On the side, two things. A fried bun and a broth 
smoked with a basil infusion. This dish was delicious but also fun. It felt like a treasure hunt 
with the crunchy almonds. Some bites, I got one, other bites I didn’t. In terms of flavors, this was excellent. Especially with the smoky broth. Love it. Arriving next is a course called Mineral Sphere. It’s a tribute to the rainy seasons 
of the year - spring and summer. Inside the crispy char shell is pink oyster 
in a green bean foam, with two kinds of sauce. One umami sauce made with 
seaweed and one with wild herbs. No instructions here, just 
break it open and go to town. The Chef masterfully combines the 
elements of nature in one dish. This is what perfection looks like. I’m ready for my next unforgettable wine. It’s a 2018 Chardonnay. You can feel the power the 
moment you catch that aroma. Coche Dury never disappoints. Our next course is dedicated to the 
traditional Italian food made especially   for the hottest days of the year. I’m talking about cold pasta. The spaghetti is made with semolina flour 
and parsley to give it the green color. On top is a wild garlic pesto. Mustard seeds for crunch. A green sauce with caviar. Herbs from the farm. And topped with more caviar. What a work of art. And it comes with a request.  Young professionals bring energy, humility, 
and bold passion to gastronomy here.  Sliding up to the table next is a part of 
Italian cuisine that might surprise you. Eel. In the north, it’s a cultural icon, 
especially in places like Comacchio,   where have an eel festival every October. And in the south, particularly 
Naples, eel is so special,   it’s part of the traditional Christmas Eve dinner. Here, the chef’s preparation 
is typical of Piedmont. Using white wine and white vinegar. Laid on a bed of millet. With some sweetness thanks 
to red onion and dried figs. Lovely presentation, with a nice kick of acidity. It’s not my favorite of the 
day, but still, I love it. This is a great wine. Super fresh, super elegant. We have one more fish course coming up. It’s turbot. It’s cooked with a bit of fennel. Finished on the top with a seaweed 
crust to replicate the skin of the fish. On the left is a tartlet stuffed with a typical 
mayonnaise from Portugal and fermented beetroot. The fish came out flawlessly cooked, and 
the sides complemented it beautifully. This course shows impressive attention to detail. Now, let’s meet the chef behind the menu. It’s none other than Enrico Bartolini. Before becoming the most Michelin-starred 
chef in Italy, Enrico made his mark abroad. Starting in Paris, then London, before 
circling back to his home country. Then, in 2016, Chef Enrico went into beast mode. Opening three restaurants this one in Mudec,   one in Bergamo and a third 
in Castiglione della Pescaia. The following year, he got two stars for 
Mudec and one for each of the others. In 2020 Mudec got the third. Bringing Enrico 12 stars in total. The most in the country. And he is also the only chef 
in Milan with three stars. Pasta raviolo, stuffed with an olive oil and 
lime emulsion, topped with roasted octopus. Around it is cacciucco sauce from 
a fish stew typical in Tuscany. It’s tomato-based, and here, it’s 
made with 15 different kinds of fish. Next in the pairing a mystery wine 
served in their famous black glass. I really love this idea and 
I'm happy to try this game. The sommelier gives me a bit more time 
and will be back to reveal the mystery. 
   Now we are coming into the home 
stretch on the Mudec experience menu This is beetroot risotto. Italian gastronomy creates dishes that 
honor the traditions of peasant cuisine,   turning simplicity into art. Every dish carries the weight of 
childhood memories and personal stories. So, they hit it with something special. An edible essence. I’ve actually had this dish 
just two days before this visit. At a Michelin star-studded Krug event. Where 10 chefs with 3 Michelin stars 
joined forces, including Enrico Bartolini. One of the the dishes served was this risotto. It was really good there, but even better here. So far here ’s no AI threat because even people   struggle to master something that can 
only be learned through experience. Now that I’ve had some time with the 
mystery wine, I’m ready to take a guess. The mystery wine is a 2004 Barolo 
riserva from producer Bruno Giacosa. What can I say practice makes the master. To make the experience even more interesting,   Edoardo serves the next wine in 
the pairing so I can compare them. It’s another barolo, this one is a 2017 Roagna. It’s a different cru, different 
vintage and a different style. Both are made with nebbiolo grapes, 
but that’s where the similarities end. These couldn’t be more different. Let’s take a short break to 
talk about something important. Important not just for me, but for You too! I get dozens of messages to 
check ‘this or that’ restaurant. Well, this is the time when I’m gonna nod to that. That’s why we created The Attention Game! If you have a restaurant and 
want to show it to the world,   this might be the best place to do that. All you have to do is go through 
a quick and easy registration. We’ll pick 10 restaurants that’ll 
get a shoutout on our channel. Then You will vote for your favorite, and we’ll 
visit and make a video about the top choice. To be honest, we are not 
looking for Michelin stars. We are searching for passion, 
creativity, and a commitment to quality. If you have these, this is for you. This is your big chance to be seen. You can apply until the end of March. The clock is ticking. Don't miss out. All the details and the 
link are in the description! Our next-to-last savory course is sweetbread. It’s cooked on a yakitori and carmelized 
with Mastiha - a classic greek spirit. On the bottom is a curry sauce with 
two types of carrot preparations. I’m happy with this dish because sweetbread is my 
favorite ingredient, and it did not disappoint. It’s superb. Our main course has deep 
roots in the local cuisine. Lamb from Alta Langa. Cooked with some hay butter and rosemary. With three types of zucchini. And it’s finished in a verjus sauce made 
with lamb stock, chives and black truffle. A perfectly prepared main 
course is right in front of me. Look at that piece of meat. Its quality is unquestionable. Savory courses are done, and now 
we are in for another surprise. A mystery pre-dessert. We have to break it open and 
guess the three ingredients. I’m guessing lentils and figs. The only thing I couldn’t figure 
out was the charcoal covering it up. Before the main dessert, a little 
splash of Chateau d’Yquem 1997. There are no fixed desserts on the menu, so 
we can choose from the à la carte selection. I love this concept. And here come the first one. Popcorn, made of corn meringue. Then, a dessert inspired by mille feuille, 
made with crunchy banana and banana confit. and finally a 70% dark chocolate 
souffle with salted peanut,   rum pineapple, coconut vinegar and toasted sesame. Everything I love is here. A creative one, a sweet classic, and a 
beautiful dessert crafted with great effort. And last but not least, here are the petit fours. Presented in a creative and fun way. Our total for today is 
eighteen hundred euros for two. Let me sum up my experience today. We see so many creations in the 
world that belong to engineers. Perfectly functional, but devoid of soul. And others that are purely artistic. Beautiful, but without structure. This restaurant is different. It’s the lovechild of both worlds, 
where engineering precision and   artistic brilliance come
together seamlessly. The menu was fantastic, and I 
absolutely enjoyed the wine pairing. And this young team is bold, 
fearless, and incredibly precise. That was fabulous afternoon. And that does it for this episode. Thank you for joining me! If you liked this video,hit subscribe See you next time!"

Check out my restaurant: 
https://www.instagram.com/42restaurant/",2024-11-10T17:00:20Z,"['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN7PHoTyCmE', 'https://www.instagram.com/alexandertheguest', 'https://www.instagram.com/42restaurant/']",OiBa9Nh0wSA,"Let me start by saying there are some things I don’t 
really love about this restaurant. It’s a bit cramped. It’s a bit uncomfortable. And there were some mistakes here and there. But if I’m being honest, none of them 
bothered me for more than a second. Let me show you why. Come with me to The Kitchen Table in London, and find out. We arrive to the entrance on Charlotte street. After a warm welcome, we are led to our table. The place is packed, and with 
these tiny tables and chairs, I feel like Gulliver in Liliput. A bubbly server presents the wine list. However, we have different plans. Today, I’m dining with friends, and we 
managed to get a few special bottles that aren’t available in many restaurants. We’ve brought them with us, 
and we will pay a corkage fee. More on the wines later. Here come our appetisers. First up, oysters. Served taco-style. The base is kohlrabi, and the creamy 
sauce is made from the oyster skirts. It’s finished with pickled 
jalapeños and fresh herbs. It has a beautiful, slightly sweet acidity. The flavor stayed on my tongue for a long time. A great start. Our next two bites arrive together. The tartlet has caramelized 
onion, then layers of crème crue, parmesan, crispy pickle, chopped 
chives and chive flowers. The smaller bite is chicken skin wafer, rosemary mascarpone, bacon jam and cornflower. The onion bite was great, but I felt 
they could have done more with the wafer. Up next, a server presents us with an opportunity. The caviar option. I will save you the sales pitch, 
and get to the bottom line. The menu goes for 300 euro. For an upcharge of 60 euro, they will add N25 Oscietra caviar 
to the upcoming scallop dish. Naturally it’s a yes. And now, finally, we are invited 
upstairs for the main event. Their logo highlights the 
connection between chefs and guests. And as the name implies, it’s just 
one, big, table in the kitchen. It is a U shape, where 20 guests enjoy 
a meal with a full view of the action. Once again, space is limited. The first of our four wines is chilled and ready. It’s a chardonnay from Benoit Moreau, a 
well-known name in Burgundy’s wine world. Four years ago, Benoît Moreau 
left the family business and established his own winery under his name. Here, we have the 2020, the initial 
release under the new label. It was nice to taste a new producer's first wine. It’s still young, but beautiful. Time to meet the chef, James Knappett. After his training, he honed his skills 
at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay and Petrus, before joining Thomas Keller at Per Se. It’s here he meets Sandia Chang. his future business partner and wife. Together, they make the move 
to Copenhagen to work at Noma. And soon, they are dreaming 
of life as restaurant owners. In 2012, they find a space in London 
and open not one, but two restaurants. In the front, Sandia opens Bubbledogs. A place for champagne and gourmet hot dogs. And at the back, James does upscale 
dining at the Kitchen Table. Two very different concepts, and 
both of them catch on like wildfire. While Bubbledogs was building a cult following, Kitchen Table was collecting Michelin stars. They got the first in the 2015 
guide, and then the second in 2018. When COVID blew into town in 2020, the couple decided to kill one of their darlings. and double down on the other. Kitchen Table expanded, renovated and 
relaunched with a more refined, elegant look. The menu changes everyday, 
depending on what is available. It revolves around fresh British ingredients 
and each course is focused on one special one. Time for our first course. Everyone has the dish in front of them. We just need Chef James to explain. It’s a bit salty with nice acidity. I want more! Another thing I really like is our Benoit Moreau. It’s really starting to open up. At first, it was very quiet, but now it is starting to find its own voice. As you can see, there’s not 
much space in the kitchen. The chefs need to know exactly where 
they’re going and what they’re doing. They need to be in sync. It’s almost like a performance, 
with choreographed movements. Watch. Here comes our next dish, with 
the extra we ordered earlier. Hand-dived Orkney scallops. Served raw, straight from the shell. Jazzed up with N25 caviar. They are dressed in a syrup of Meyer lemon. These are sweeter and less acidic, 
but with tons of intensity. Ultra fresh and just the perfect dish. In the black bowl is the unseasoned white meat. Topped with unripe hazelnuts slices. There is also fresh apple dice,   with yogurt mixed with apple marigold 
and a warm apple soup poured around it. In the tartlet is marmalade made from 
apples, green strawberries, and elderflower. With whipped crab meat and 
reduction from the shell. Finished with wild fennel pollen. They're cooking at a very high level. Both of these were exciting. Our second wine is a chardonnay. A 2018 Meursault from Domaine Bernard Bonin. Domaine Bernard-Bonin is run 
by the husband-and-wife team. I truly appreciate the work of this couple. Coming up, bread fresh from the oven. Brushed with homemade 
cultured butter and sea salt. Next to it is more butter mixed 
with wild garlic preserves. Dusted with burnt wild garlic leaves 
and topped with fermented flowers. The bread course was excellent. And the burnt garlic element was fantastic. So far, the food has been great, 
and the service has been attentive. But when things happen out of 
nowhere, I can see some cracks. During the bread course, I reached out with greasy hands to 
pick up my water glass and spilled it. The staff were quick to react with good 
humor, but forgot to refill the water. In like 3 minutes they even 
baked me a little loaf of bread to replace the piece that got wet. Baking bread takes so much more effort 
than pouring a simple glass of water. But the energy here in the kitchen is so powerful that even the challenge of baking bread 
is a breeze compared to pouring water. On top, a homemade chutney made from magnolia. It sits on pickled samphire, and on the bottom is a sauce made from 
roasted bones of the fish and champagne. I know I’m repeating myself, 
but this was also excellent. Chef James hit another bullseye with this one. Another new wine enters the mix. A big one. A 2008 Meursault from 
legendary producer Coche Dury. This is Les Rougeots. An iconic white Burgundy with a 
reputation that lives up to the hype. And a price tag of 2000 euros to match. Another fish course is next. This time it’s Chalk Stream Trout. The fish is flaked down on 
pickled onions and elderflower and presented on salt-baked 
potatoes cooked with aged wagyu fat. Simple but great flavors which I liked. Next, we get a little preview 
of our upcoming lobster course. I can’t wait for this one. Since the guys brought the wines today, I thought it would only be fair 
if I got a special champagne. It’s called RDJ Number One. It’s a rare bottle, with only 300 released. It’s nice, but at this point, the bar is high. After the big Burgundy wines earlier, this champagne has less 
chance to make a big impact. But we feel fortunate to have 
a chance to try this one. The lobster is back! It’s lobster tail, with scrambled eggs 
cooked with the brain of the lobster. They are sitting on caramelized mango, 
toasted peanuts, and coriander stems. Around the outside is a sauce from roasted shells. The flavors, the textures, the 
temperatures all sensational. I’m floored by this incredible dish. Our red wine is opened next. Here is another contender that 
might just sweep me off my feet. It’s a 30-year-old Gevrey Chambertin 
from Domaine Armand Rousseau. A poor vintage and a village pinot, it shouldn't be this impressive, but it is. It’s remarkable how an excellent 
producer crafted such a refined wine from a modest vintage and a humble vineyard. This wine will go great with the upcoming course. Presented here before carving. It’s North Yorkshire duck, 
simply cooked in its own fat. But first, a stuffed pasta called Agnolotti. The filling is pumpkin, baked in the 
oven with brown sugar, garlic, and thyme. On top is 36-month-aged parmesan 
sauce with black peppercorn. Served with Scottish girolle 
mushrooms and black garlic. Another really strong dish. The sauce made from the aged parmesan was amazing. Could this be my new favorite kitchen in London? Before we know it, the duck is back. Over the top, we have a sauce 
made from the roasted bones. I’m amazed by the way the 
chef combines ingredients. Like the broth made from barbecued mackerel bones, roasted shrimp heads, oil made from corn husks… and many more. For the chef there is no such thing as useless. It’s infused with black 
pepper and wild elderberries. Underneath is a sausage made from the legs. Salted rhubarb from Yorkshire 
and ketchup made from damson. Perfectly cooked, tender, and juicy,   with some really nice flavors 
coming from the salted rhubarb. I really liked this one. Around this point, my napkin gets away from me. But since the space is small and sort of 
hidden from sight, the servers didn’t catch it. But to be honest, I don't care. The flavors are so intense and bold, 
the trivial things don’t bother me. The duck is back again. This time in a tartlet. The shell is made from roasted cherry juice. On top of the duck is fresh English black 
cherry, with anise hyssop leaves and flowers. What I really love about the chef's table 
concept is that I get to see experts at work. How the head chef directs the team, how they 
collaborate, and what their processes are like. Chef James is 100% in the game. I love it. A cheese dish is next. The base is curds from 
unpasteurized cow’s milk cheese. And on top are figs from the 
Chef’s garden in North London. This dish uses ripe and green figs, 
and it’s finished with fig leaf oil. Interesting textures, and the 
flavor was fine, it was a good dish. Savory courses done, now 
it’s time for the sweet ones. The first is a light blackberry 
soup with sweet corn ice cream   and dressed with oil made from corn husks. I’m not sure what sorcery this 
is, but it’s sinfully delicious. It’s sweet, it’s sour, and 
just really interesting. I can’t even find the words. Our next dessert revolves around the raspberry. Here we see it prepared in different ways, 
dressed up with milk and coffee tuiles. Another delicious dessert here, but 
I’m still thinking about the last one. With the desserts done, we are back 
to the lounge for the petit fours. A canelé with summer berry jam. And a banana croustade with smoked caramel. And that will do it for 
dinner at the Kitchen Table. Total for today is thirty-two hundred euro. How can I describe the Kitchen Table experience? Filling a glass to the very top without 
any spilling over the side is difficult. You can fill it easily to ninety-nine 
percent safely, and it appears full. You’re safe, and the person 
you poured it for is satisfied. It's always the last few drops that are the 
hardest to pour to make it completely full. Here in Kitchen Table, the glass is full. Completely full. The flavors are so maximized,   while still balanced, that even a 
pinch of salt could tip the scale. It's that sharpness of flavor that 
makes me truly love a kitchen. Because it's difficult, it's 
risky, and it's impressive. This place has it. I was lucky to try their confident menu 
that doesn’t hold back or play it safe. For dishes like this, I'm happy 
to give up a little space. I will even make space at the top of my list. Kitchen Table is my new 
favorite kitchen in London. And that does it for this episode. Thank you for joining me! If you like this video, hit subscribe! See you next time."
Dining at the WORLD RECORD BREAKING Restaurant - Atelier Moessmer,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgqhbbYs7a4,"Today, we’re going to dine at a restaurant that has set a world record. From opening the doors, to hanging up a 3 Michelin star plate in just four months. It's called Atelier Moessmer by Norbert Niederkofler.
Although Atelier Moessmer is just a year old, Chef Norbert is a seasoned chef.
He created his philosophy over 25 years ago called Cook the Mountain.

Check out my restaurant: 
https://www.instagram.com/42restaurant/",2024-11-03T17:01:03Z,"['https://ateliernorbertniederkofler.com/en/', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN7PHoTyCmE', 'https://www.instagram.com/alexandertheguest', 'https://www.instagram.com/42restaurant/']",zgqhbbYs7a4,"Today, we’re going to a restaurant 
that has set a world record. From opening the doors, to hanging up a 3 
Michelin star plate in just four months. Welcome to South Tyrol. Located in Northern Italy. Confused? Tyrol is a historic region in the Alps. At one time, it belonged to 
the Austro-Hungarian empire. After World War I, a big chunk 
was broken off and given to Italy. It included Trentino, Trieste and South Tyrol. As you can see, this part 
of the world is stunning. A perfect setting for fine dining. I don’t know much about this place, but I know 
that their concept is called Cook the Mountain. I’m a bit skeptical, yet curious at the same time. The building is huge and beautifully preserved. You can feel the history as you 
pass through its elegant spaces. We are shown to the garden where we will 
enjoy the first part of our experience. This place feels magical. We get a warm welcome from the culinary 
wizard, Chef Norbert Niederkofler, who personally greets every guest. I settle in with a glass of Jacque 
Selosse and take a peek at the wine list. They have a wine pairing for 180 euros, which includes a little bit of everything Including local, Italian and German wines. As I’m in the mood for some amazing wines, I order two bottles - one white and one red. Which ones? I leave it up to Restaurant 
Manager and Head Sommelier, Lukas. First bites are next. A small tart with marinated shrimp, 
walnut and fermented black currant powder. A churros made from local flowers 
topped with emulsions of egg, creme fraishe and chives. A flatbread with prosciutto and 
cream cheese with local herbs. And last, bauerntoast and 
a special kind of cheese. I will let executive chef Mauro explain. His hope became a reality. Lots of textures and flavors that surprised me. Out of the ordinary, I enjoy the boldness here. Already, I can say that this service 
team has had excellent training. They are young, but their 
movement is incredibly precise. I think this will be a great experience. With a taste of what we can 
expect, we take a look at the menu. The fuzzy cover is a traditional 
wool fabric called Loden. It shows the connection between the restaurant 
and the historic location we are in. We are sitting in the garden of the old 
executive villa for textile producer Moessmer. Founded in 1894, they designed and 
dressed the royals of the Habsburg court. The factory is still just across the road and today makes ultra high-quality fabric 
for brands like Louis, Chanel and Gucci. As a tribute to its roots, 
they kept the name Moessmer. The only big change is the 
addition of a modern kitchen. Next, we head inside for our 
first courses and choose our wine. Lukas presents us with three options. Two Italian and one French. I take my pick. It’s a 2021 Primo Grande Cuvée from Terlan. It’s one of the best-rated white 
wines in Italy at the moment. The menu starts with one of their 
most intense and complex dishes. Summer salad, with 20 to 30 different types of 
leaf, herb, and flower, depending on the day. Finished with a gaspacho dressing. On the side is grissini filled with homemade 
pesto with the leftovers from the salad. They are not messing around. Really exciting with intense flavors. The gazpacho dressing complemented it 
perfectly, and the grissini added a nice crunch. This is a beautiful start. We are one course into the tasting 
menu called “Cook the Mountain.” I am super curious how they will 
reflect this in the upcoming dishes. It’s 14 courses for 320 euros, with the option 
of ordering some of Chef Norbert’s classics. I am in. Our bottle of red shows up. Lucas took my request seriously 
and chose a real big gun. It’s a 2010 Barolo Monfortino 
from Giacomo Conterno. Chef Norbert is back. This time to give us a 
guided tour of the property. When he took over this heritage building, he found himself bound by strict 
regulations when it came to renovation. It led to some clever solutions. One of them was to break up the 
dining space into different areas. We see a lot of preserved history. Both from the textile factory and the original notes for Chef 
Norbert’s Cook the Mountain philosophy. Among all these relics of the 
past, something modern stands out. Every room has one of these high-end 
speakers that delivers gorgeous sound. Good sound is something Chef Norbert 
values almost as much as the food itself. The tour concludes in Chef 
Norbert’s favorite place. It’s full of bells and whistles 
and includes a chef’s table. To create this, they had to build a separate 
structure with totally different architecture. Although Atelier Moessmer is just a year 
old, Chef Norbert is a seasoned chef. For over 25 years, he ran the St. 
Hubertus restaurant in Hotel Rosa Alpina, just 45 minutes from here. They received their first star in the year 2000, the second in 2007 and the third in 2017. When the hotel announced it was 
closing for major renovations, Chef Norbert moved his operation here. He created his philosophy over 25 years ago. Cook the Mountain. Here, Chef explains. A fish course is next. It’s summer trout, twice smoked. It’s topped with trout roe, and 
different phases of the elderflower. The final touch is kefir. I’m not a big fan of trout roe, but 
it blended beautifully with the dish. The kefir added a playful and light freshness. Really nice flavors, great textures. This was a brilliant dish. Our bread service is next. It’s simple sourdough. With bee pollen to add flavor and sweetness. And a mix of seeds for texture. It’s served with a butter 
that is whipped like cream. I have to say, I prefer 
butter in its classic form. Our first classic dishes are next. It’s white fish tartare. It showcases how we can use 
the whole fish in one bowl. The tartar is made from 
the best parts of the fish, and the rest is cooked down into a broth. On top, deep fried scales of the 
fish, green apple and some dill oil. The sauce was super concentrated 
with beautiful flavors. It was also a game of temperature, 
with warm sauce and cold tartare. I get the sense that there’s some serious 
cooking happening behind the scenes. It’s like modern gastronomic alchemy. So far, everything has been excellent. The presentation has beautiful 
plates and great plating. And the flavors are incredibly strong as well. We are moving to the chef’s 
table for our next few courses. Coming up, a classic Italian risotto. The base is cooked in buttermilk, and richness 
is elevated further with sheep butter. The dish is super aromatic 
thanks to trigonella herbs. It’s finished with two creams. One made with wild mountain greens 
emulsified with black currant wood oil. And the second is based on donkey milk. Together, this dish has a 
beautiful velvety texture. This was really good, but it wasn’t 
as exciting as the previous dishes. When we think about eating snails, 
French cuisine often jumps to mind. But it’s actually a whole South European thing. Including here in Italy. And it’s our next course. Snails, cooked in a horseradish cream. Underneath is a paste of watercress and the dish is completed with 
ramson tempura and seasonal herbs. Absolutely incredible. The flavors were cleverly constructed, 
and paired together perfectly. The seasonal herbs amazingly 
complemented the flavor of the snails. I can say, this was the best snail 
dish I’ve ever had in my life. Our next course is an innovative 
tribute to a childhood favorite macaroni. It’s called Pajata alla Mamma Rosa. Instead of pasta, they use tender veal pajata, slow cooked to mimic the texture 
of the famous comfort food. For sauce, they use wild hip rose buds, 
sauteed onions, garlic and white wine. It’s topped with watercress oil. Another banger. We have great news for you. When we reach 500,000 subscribers, 
we will have another insane giveaway. We’re still a little far from there, but you all keep saying that the 
channel deserves more subscribers. You said it, not me. But the truth is, 66% of you watch 
our videos without subscribing. So if you guys hit the subscribe button, 
we can reach that goal much faster. Let’s get there together! Details coming soon. Before our next course, we 
get some bad-ass knives. Traditional and hand-crafted 
especially for the restaurant, by Mauro’s dad, a 2nd generation knife maker. Our main course is fischione. It’s a breed of duck also known as widgeon. Is it a cousin to the pigeon? It sure sounds like it. Here it’s cooked on an open fire. Served on a homemade pesto, 
with a piece of fillet. Finished with the sauce of the duck, and topped with locally-grown New Zealand spinach and chanterelle mushrooms 
finished on the open fire. It also comes with a side. It’s cevapcici, made with the 
drippings from other meat courses. Let’s hear Lukas explain the 
best way to attack this course. This was a serious dish. Cooking over an open fire changes the game. Especially when it’s cooked as perfect as this. A superb main course. The sweet courses are coming up, signaled by the seamless switch 
of water glasses and napkins. Notice the graceful movement. Our first dessertis an apricot 
sorbet made in the smoker. Served on a crumble with buttermilk 
sabayon and topped with apricot powder. The staff are young but professional and 
you can feel they are happy to be here. Genuine smiles don’t get better than this! The same goes for this perfect mirror service. Our main dessert is served by 
the member of the pastry team. It’s rhubarb, poached in 
elderflower syrup and white chard. Topped with creamy yogurt 
mascarpone, a compote of red berries, and pieces of meringue. The dust on top is bee pollen, woodruff 
powder, and fermented red berries. Both desserts were great and fit 
perfectly with the flow of the menu. I really liked them. With dinner service over, the 
kitchen is free for a tour. Chef Mauro explains one of the 
challenges of cooking the mountain is storing and preserving ingredients. He calls this fridge the library. From here, we have one more stop on the tour. The wine cellar. We are back at the chef’s table, 
just in time for one more bite. It’s another classic - Tarte Tatin. An upside-down caramelized apple tart. Served with fresh yogurt ice cream. It’s warm and rich flavors 
with cool and creamy textures. What could be better than apple pie and ice cream? Look at that perfection. It tastes as good as it looks. Last but not least, are the petit fours. With tarts, cookies, and jellies to see us off. Our total for today is just over 
thirty-three hundred euros for three people. So what do I think of Atelier Moessmer? The flavors were super intense, 
and the hospitality was perfect. I enjoyed the playfulness and 
beauty of the architecture, where the classic meets the modern. Just like this outstanding 
mentor and his young team. For me, He is not just a chef; He is an amazing mentor. He is not just cooking the mountain, He is the artist of the mountain. Many say that you can’t work with the 
new generation the same way anymore. It seems Norbert has found a way to connect 
with them, inspire them, and lead them. The chef has put all his life 
experience into this restaurant. You should come here and 
try to find a mistake in it. I must confess, I didn’t find any. and that does it for this episode. Thank you for joining me! If you like this video, HIT SUBSCRIBE! See you next time."

A man with a checkered past. In his early years, with no purpose 
in life, he ended up in a gang. And for years, was a member of 
Copenhagen’s crime underworld. By chance, he found something 
that would set him straight. And met a woman who shared the same dream. Together, they would sell their most 
prized possessions to make it a reality. Today, Chef Eric and his wife are the heart and soul of Denmark’s 
newest 3-Michelin star restaurant. And living proof that it’s never 
too late to turn things around. Today, we travel north of 
Copenhagen to meet the couple and sample the cuisine at Jordnaer. It’s a short drive from central Copenhagen 
to the affluent suburb of Gentofte. One of the wealthiest parts of the country. And the birthplace of 
Metallica drummer, Lars Ulrich. Besides large villas and green spaces, 
you can find Bernstorff Palace, which was once the summer 
residence of Danish royalty. We arrive at the Gentofte hotel. From the look of it, you would never guess 
there was a Michelin star restaurant in there. That’s exactly what I thought when 
I first came here two years ago. I thought the navigation was wrong, and we kept walking around looking for it. But this is it. It’s a 400-year-old building. Like most buildings in Denmark, 
it’s functional and minimalist. Walking inside, the red Michelin 
plate tells you it’s the right place. I’m early. They don’t open for another 30 
minutes, but once they notice me, I’m welcomed with a smile, 
and invited to come inside. One of the first things I 
notice is the style of the team. They are impeccably and beautifully dressed. Right away, I meet Tina. She runs the front of house and 
is one of the restaurant owners. She is also the wife of the chef. We have a good chat about the world's restaurants. She has a strong opinion and it’s refreshing. And it’s always nice to meet another 
person who tells it like it is. The dining room is modest but charming. Every part of the table 
arrangement is top quality. Tonight, we are a party of five. Tristan Farmer, former executive chef 
at Zen in Singapore, and his partner. Also joining us is a Japanese chef 
who cooks Italian cuisine in Germany. And a man named Marco who 
happens to be a bonsai master. And of course, me. Chef Eric comes out to say hello. He has known some of these guys for years. You can tell he is a warm person. And he’s a hugger. Before the first bites arrive, our 
server starts us off with champagne. Because of their connections with Eric 
and Tina, this one is on the house. This is a 2014 Terre De 
Vertus Blanc de Blancs magnum. It's always a great feeling to 
taste a magnum bottle by the glass. The tasting menu is Scandinavian with 
Japanese highlights for 500 euros. And it starts with appetisers. The first has a shell made from aged Comté. It’s topped with romanesco 
broccoli cooked in lemon leaf oil, with fresh goat cheese, and toasted almonds. We should eat it in one bite. Interesting textures, nice 
crunch and a good start. Up next we have another tartlet. It’s king crab, mussel cream, and a sake emulsion with Japanese tabasco sauce. Decorated with seasonal wild 
and farmed herbs and flowers. Beautiful presentation. The next one-bite appetizer is 
Spanish tuna marinated with wasabi in a soy sauce emulsion topped with kaluga caviar. Chef Eric comes out to introduce our final snack. It’s called Rossette Waffle. Here, chef Eric re-purposes a tool used 
to make a traditional Swedish pastry. He creates a shell using 
Japanese beer-batter dough. And fills it with a salad of 
shrimp, creme fraiche and chives. These bites were both beautiful and delicious. I’ve been here before, and I find the 
textures of these appetizers have improved. For wine, they have several 
pairing options to choose from. As well as alcohol-free. Instead of a pairing,   we decide to order two vintages of 
Charles Heidsieck Blanc des Millenaires and put the two champagnes head-to-head. Only eight of these special cuvees 
have been released, starting in 1983. They are produced from wines of the same year and only when the cellar master 
recognizes them as extraordinary. Today we will try two of them. From 2004 and 2006. When it comes to vintage 
wine, the year is everything. Especially here in Europe, where the differences in wine from 
one year to the next can be huge. For two reasons. Regulation and most importantly: The weather. In Europe, winemakers are bound by regulations. From watering, to harvesting and production. They need to follow the rules to the letter. Second is the weather. The vintage reflects the year it was made. And depending on the conditions, it can make a huge impact, on 
both the wine and the prices. For example, the year 2015 
was exceptional in Burgundy. Take the Romanee-Conti Grand Cru. The 2014 has a list price of 19 thousand euros. The 2015 is 34 thousand. With Leroy Musigny Grand Cru, 
the difference is even bigger. The 2014 goes for 60,000 euros. And the 2015 is more than three times that amount. It’s over 200,000 euros. In New World wine, they are not 
bound by such strict regulations. They can be flexible and innovative. They can offset the effects of poor 
weather with advanced techniques. It allows them to make more 
consistent wines year-in and year-out. Snacks are over, now it’s time for some courses. This is scallop, rose, and white currants. It’s diced hand-dived scallops from Norway. Topped with gooseberry gel and finger lime. The sauce is made with 
white currants and rose oil. Finally, on top, is a skewer of 
petals from the Japanese clove. I like the floral flavors, but 
some of the flowers were bitter and overpowered the taste of the scallop. Next, is one of the chef’s signatures. It’s called Langoustine Essence. At the bottom is a tartar made from 
langoustine tail and claw meat. It’s topped with jelly made 
from langoustine bouillon, tomato, cognac and vanilla. It’s finished with tomato water from 
Sicilian Marinda tomatoes and olive oil. I like the different layers and textures. It's a clever dish. Our server introduces our next dish 
as “a little dessert in between.” On the bottom, we have the poached 
tail of Danish black lobster seasoned with timut pepper. The next layer is a panna cotta based 
on sheep cream and white asparagus. With a grapefruit gel on top. Finished with a warm reduction 
using citrus juice and sugar. As our server says: Like a bittersweet symphony. Then, Chef Eric comes to the table, And tells us more about their operation. They are open for dinner just four 
days a week, from Tuesday to Friday. And once a month, they open for lunch on Saturday. It’s the most popular lunch in 
town and sells out in an instant. Chef Eric’s story is a lot different 
than the average Michelin star chef. He grew up in northwest Copenhagen. As a kid, he and his friends started 
stealing cars and robbing places. Soon, they were involved in organized crime. By age 13, his parents had enough. And kicked him out. Throughout his teens, he bounced around juvenile detention 
centers and training schools. One of those schools would change his life. At 16, he was sent on a 
sailing trip for troubled kids, where he was posted in the kitchen, 
cooking meals for the crew. It’s here that he had a revelation. It’s the one place where his mind felt free. Eric returned to Copenhagen with 
his heart set on cooking school. But before long, he fell back into his old ways. His big break into fine dining 
came from his brother Torsten. He was a chef at Noma, and invited Eric to help out at the 
newly minted 1 Michelin star restaurant. For three years, he learned on the job 
and was able to combine his natural talent with some of the best training in the world. Under superchef Rene Redzepi, Eric 
developed his cooking techniques, leadership style and philosophy. Then, he went to cooking school. Normally, it takes four years. But Eric finished in 18 months with the 
highest grades in the school’s history. Things seemed to be looking up. But soon, Eric would be spiraling again. Luckily, a friend was there to help. He introduced Chef Eric to the owners 
of a restaurant north of Copenhagen. It’s where he met Tina, the front-of-house. It wasn’t long before she 
fell in love with his cooking, and then the man himself. Before she knew it, he popped the question. They made such a good team, they thought why not start their own restaurant. They would call it Jordnaer, 
which means ‘down to earth.’ A reflection of the owners, not the food. The menu would be focused on Scandinavian 
cuisine with Japanese elements. And they would operate by the mantra 
“Only the best for our guests.” There was just one small problem. Money. To help finance the operation, they sold his gold watch and her diamond ring. It was enough to get them started 
in a worn-out dining room. They poured their hearts into it, 
and soon, customers were lining up. After 9 months of operation, they 
got their first Michelin star. In 2020, they got the second and found themselves on the 
World’s 50 Best Restaurants list. They were living the dream. Then in February 2023, a short in the wiring caused 
the kitchen to go up in flames. Repairs took over two months, but they reopened with the same 
dedication to serving guests. And they got the third Michelin star in 2024. They have come a long, long way. And to think that it all came from 
a boat trip for troubled kids. It’s a truly heartwarming story. Our next course is hamachi fish. The fish has been dry-aged for 11 days. And served here in two preparations. The three pieces on the top come from 
the loin in the middle of the fillet. On the bottom, we have a ravioli 
with the belly of the fish. Inside is fresh wasabi with 
French Gillardeau oyster. The sauce is a homemade ponzu with sesame oil. Ponzu is a Japanese sauce based 
on soy sauce and citrus juice. This is our second Norwegian 
king crab dish of the day. Chawanmushi. With crab legs, raw shrimps, and Ossetra caviar. Around a warm tea split with 
mandarin oil and fresh wasabi. Topped with a perfect sancho leaf. These leaves have a citrusy, peppery 
flavor with a hint of numbing sensation. Chawanmushi is a classic 
Japanese savory egg custard that is steamed in a delicate cup. It’s ultra smooth and silky. This dish is beautiful. It hurts me to destroy this presentation. Getting back to our 2004 and 2006 
Charles Heidsieck Blanc des Millenaires, it’s really nice to taste these two 
glorious champagnes side-by-side. They are so different. 2006 was an extreme year for weather. Cold and snowy winter, with 
record high temperatures in July, a cold and rainy August, followed 
by a dry, sunny September. In 2004, the weather was much more favorable. It allowed them to make an 
especially beautiful champagne. Compared to the 2006, it’s 
fresher and more dynamic. This is Langoustine and sakura. The tail of langoustine is grilled over 
charcoal and brushed in a kosho oil. The sauce is a beurre blanc 
based on sakura vinegar and split with spicy Yuzu Kosho oil. Nice dish, but I miss the punchiness. I love the choice of plate. These are thoughtfully 
selected and truly impressive. The presentation is also beautifully done. From his appearance, you'd never guess the chef 
could create such a thing. Our main course for today is Danish Dover Sole grilled on binchotan with 
oak and cherry wood chips. On the bottom of the plate are grilled green peas, and the sauce is a dashi reduction. Perfect ingredients are crucial to the chef. And here, there is no compromise. If they find the perfect 
ingredient locally, they'll use it. But if not, they bring it in. Even going so far as Japan. This mentality is close to my heart. I have to run to the airport, but I have just enough time for dessert. Our first is this. Honeydew melon infused with lemon verbena. Milk ice cream, freshly whipped sheep’s cream. And a sauce made with lavender. The second dessert is wild 
strawberries from France with sauce made from rhubarb and 
a scoop of hip rose sorbet on top. Both desserts were superb. It’s time to settle up and go. My total for today is 938 euros. Unfortunately, I have a flight to catch, so I take my petit fours with me 
and have a nice snack in the taxi. What can I tell you about Jordnaer? The hotel doesn’t exactly scream quality. But when you find the restaurant, 
you will be surprised. The fusion of Nordic and 
Japanese cuisine was fascinating. I liked that they weren’t 
exclusive to local ingredients, and they make no compromises on quality. Here, they use the best, even if it means getting it from another country. The same goes for the tools on the table. It’s only the best for their guests. Despite being self-financed, the 
utensils here are top quality. How about the menu? It was an elegant, sophisticated experience. We had bites with exciting flavors, 
and many excellent fish dishes. But I was expecting a few 
courses with more texture, and sometimes I missed the intensity. The presentation was superb. Chef Eric’s beautiful creations 
are ready-made for Instagram. Perhaps more impressive is 
that all of these detailed, sensitive presentations are made 
by such a huge, tattooed man. I truly admire that level of sensitivity. Eric makes some of the most 
beautiful dishes on earth. On the service side, I see 
improvement since my last visit. Last time, it was accurate and 
precise, but a bit mechanical. This time, it had more of a human touch. It’s clear that it’s well-organized, 
scripted, and practiced, with a knowledgeable sommelier, and Tina shining bright like a diamond. However, there were times when I wanted a waiter but didn’t see one in the dining room. I think they could use one or two 
more skilled people in service. Overall, I had a great time here. This couple has an incredible presence. Tina is a woman with a remarkable 
presence, someone who is hard to forget. How they built this wonderful restaurant 
from the ground up is truly inspiring. And I want to congratulate 
them on achieving their dream. They had incredible faith when 
they opened their restaurant, and it paid off. Huge respect for them. And That does it for this episode. Thank you for joining me. If you like this video, Hit subscribe. See you next time! They had incredible faith when they 
opened their restaurant, and it paid off. Huge respect for them."
I Tried LONDON'S NEWEST 3 Michelin Star Restaurant - The Ledbury,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKTymlV7dzU,"Our restaurant for today is called The Ledbury. This year, 2024, they became London’s newest 3 Michelin star restaurant. It's located in Notting Hill, one of London’s prettiest neighborhoods.
The head chef is Brett Graham.

My name is Alexander. I’m the co-owner of a ONE Michelin star restaurant, and I’m on a mission - to find inspiration in gastronomy. I love fine dining, good wine and sharing what I know with other people.
----------------------------------------------------------------

Check out my restaurant: 
https://www.instagram.com/42restaurant/",2024-09-08T16:00:09Z,"['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN7PHoTyCmE', 'https://www.instagram.com/alexandertheguest', 'https://www.instagram.com/42restaurant/']",DKTymlV7dzU,"Just when everyone thought it was gone for good, this restaurant beat the odds 
and made a remarkable comeback. They held 2 Michelin stars for over a decade. Then, under the black cloud of covid, like many restaurants, they closed. And they were stripped of their Michelin stars. Many people thought they would never re-open. 2 years later, they rose like a sleeping bear. And, they were hungry. They opened the doors, and within 
one year, had both stars back. This year, 2024, they became London’s 
newest 3 Michelin star restaurant. It’s called The Ledbury. I’m really curious about this place, 
because this meal will be special. It was a name day gift from my wife. To my daughter and me. And lucky for us it takes us to one 
of London’s prettiest neighborhoods. Notting Hill. You might have seen the 1999 movie. Either by choice or against your will. It’s the one where boy meets 
girl, spills juice all over her, and somehow turns it into an unlikely love story. Besides a hit movie, what’s 
so special about this place? People say it has a story-book feel. With a mix of pastel-colored townhouses, 
cozy cafes, and charming restaurants. Like this one. The Ledbury. One of London’s newest to 
receive 3 Michelin stars. Stepping inside The Ledbury, the space 
is elegant with floor-to-ceiling windows and beautiful materials, 
right down to the tablecloth. When it was renovated in 2022, they reduced the number of seats from 55 to 45 to make space for the center serving table. However, I still find the 
tables are a bit close together. I can’t imagine what it was 
like with 10 extra seats. The staff are well-dressed, in good spirits, and get us started with a welcome drink. Sometimes I like to try new things, but tonight I want to start 
with something I know is good. So I go with a Krug 171 You may have noticed I am drinking from a 
Pinot Noir glass and not a champagne flute. This is one of the best choice of glassware 
to experience the champagne’s full expression. Olivier Krug once said that 
drinking champagne from a flute is like going to the opera and wearing earplugs. Looking at the wine list, 
they have a nice selection, as well as an interesting pairing with wines 
from 7 different countries for 160 euros. But tonight is special. So I have brought a little something with me. A 2010 Batard Montrachet Grand 
Cru from Domaine Leflaive. Domaine Leflaive is a Burgundy region all-star. They are the most prestigious 
winery in Puligy-Montrachet. With an impressive amount of vineyard holdings. Including 5 hectares of premier 
cru and 13 hectares of grand cru. This bottle retails for over 1200 euros, and it’s one of my favorite big hitters. Some restaurants, especially newer ones, don’t have a huge wine list with 
all the vintages under the sun. So to help serve the guests 
in the best way possible, they let the guests bring their own wine. Then the sommelier takes over from there. They chill it, open it and serve it. It’s a great way to accommodate the customer if the restaurant has a limited wine list. And since They are work with 
it, cool it and serve it, They charge a corking fee. Here at The Ledbury, it’s 90 euros 
for a standard size bottle of wine. So it’s a win-win. The menu here at The Ledbury is a fixed, 
8-course tasting menu for 260 euros. It comes in a printed folder that 
makes me wonder if Batman is nearby. Looking at the line-up of courses, 
I’m really looking forward to this. Especially the Iberian pork. Our first bites arrive. A chestnut biscuit, and cured meat, and then a scallop tempura with 
seaweed mustard and lobster emulsion. Nice range of flavors and textures here. Solid openers. Next, our server presents some 
Australian black truffles. For an extra charge of 45 euros, they will add them here and 
there throughout the menu. I’m in. Two more bites arrive. A lobster tartlet with 
bisque jelly and N25 caviar. and a rye pancake, with 
pancetta and black truffle, has a nice combination of salty and umami. I don’t often have cured meat or such 
heavy and fatty bites at the start. At first, I didn't quite 
understand these rustic dishes, but then the first course arrived. Chef Brett Graham swings by our 
table to present our first course. It’s marinated trout, with 
raspberry, salted cherry blossom, frozen spring flowers, and freshly grated wasabi. This course beautifully transitioned 
from the richer, fatty bites to a light, delicate flavor profile. It was like the beginning 
of Beethoven’s 5th Symphony starting robustly, then transitioning 
into a more delicate, romantic part. Explosive flavor profile and a great 
example of different textures here. Next is seabass, shaved 
asparagus, oyster, and elderflower topped with buttermilk sorbet 
and dusted with kaffir lime. It looks like an art piece. It’s a complex dish with delicate 
ingredients executed perfectly. So many textures and temperatures. They put a lot of work into this dish, and in the end we get a very 
delicately composed set of flavors. Bread is next. We have a rye-based sourdough with oats and a brioche with cheddar and honey. Served with goat’s whey 
butter covered in molasses. The bread was good quality but 
was missing that nice crunch. Veal sweetbread hits the table next. With vin jaune, English peas and vadouvan. Finished in a foam with 
lemongrass, ginger, and coconut. I like it. Chef Graham is in and out of the kitchen steady. Greeting people, plating dishes, and 
at the same time, really enjoying it. It’s clear that he has a 
connection with his guests. Chef Brett Graham was born 
in Newcastle, Australia, and began his culinary journey at 
age 15 in a local fish restaurant. His passion for cooking led him to Sydney, where he honed his skills at Banc 
restaurant and earned himself an award. Josephine Pinolet Young Chef of the Year. Soon, he was on his way to the UK, where he trained under Michelin star 
chef Phil Howard at The Square in London. A sister restaurant was opened in 2005, 
with Chef Graham behind the stove. They called it The Ledbury. The first Michelin star came a year later, followed by star number two in 2010. In 2011 it was voted best restaurant in London. All was well, but in 2020, 
they took a turn for the worse. Like many restaurants around the world, The Ledbury was hit hard by COVID. And Chef Graham made the tough 
decision to close up shop. Causing The Ledbury to lose 
both its Michelin stars. A big renovation soon followed, 
and they re-opened in 2022. One year later, both Michelin stars were returned. And this year, in 2024, they got number three. One thing is for sure, they know 
how to create a good atmosphere. The service is precise, and the food 
we’ve had so far has been really good. The only thing I don’t like is 
how close together the tables are. Next to us is still empty, 
but probably not for long. My Batard Montrachet has 
been performing beautifully. But as we get closer to the main course, I ask the sommelier to surprise 
me with a red wine to go with it. This is Wild Turbot, roasted on the 
barbeque and smoked with chamomile. Served with Scottish girolles and young peach. and topped with Australian Black truffle. The sauce is made with yuzu and chamomile. Next up is Mushrooms from the cabinet. Here at The Ledbury, they grow their own mushrooms, 
with everything on display. This dish centers around a ravioli 
filled with porcini and truffles. It’s served with a vegetable sauce made 
with shiitake and oyster mushrooms. We also have potato, buckwheat koji, and watercress with the whole thing 
topped with fresh black truffles. It’s erupting in umami. I love it. and here comes the red wine. It ’s a 2017 Cabernet Franc from the 
Chinon appellation of the Loire Valley. It was chosen for its acidity and earthy notes that are sure to go well with our main course. Which is Iberian pork. With English cherry, black olive, 
liquorice, amazake, and shiso. Chef Graham also has an Iberian pig farm. Besides his restaurants, he also supplies many other 
top restaurants in the country. Here we can taste different cuts of pork. I found it too intensive due to the aging process. and personally i didn’t feel the balance here. Otherwise, it was a good dish, 
well-made with a lot of effort. Although my daughter liked it very much, compared to the others, 
this dish fell short for me. Desserts are next. Our first dessert is called Gariguette Strawberry. It’s fromage blanc, crunchy meringue, and nasturtium topped with strawberry granita. Dripped over top is 12-year-old balsamic vinegar. The balsamic was super strong and 
really overpowered everything. It wasn't for me. The main dessert is up next. This is mille feuille and mango, 
lemon verbena, stem ginger, and mint. It looks so pretty and then… The cameraman gets butter fingers. My daughter wasn't very empatetic. Even though the presentation was destroyed, the dessert itself was really good. The cool parfait is also nice, 
with just the right acidity, and I liked the variety in textures. The creaminess and the crunch make it fun. The kaffir lime shows up again 
and comes through as well. The sommelier jumps into action to ease 
the pain with a dessert wine from Hungary. This 2017 5 puttonyos aszú from Royal Tokaji. The server noticed my little accident, and probably everyone else in the restaurant. To my surprise, they give me another. But this is something new. And it’s super creative. Jasmine custard flan with fresh almonds, peach and sake sorbet, and fig leaf ice cream. Amazing. The peach flavor really stands out. This is why you should throw around your 
phone in 3 Michelin-star restaurant. I think I will do it more often. Just the petit fours are left. Here we have mushroom fudge with sea salt. Cake with passionfruit verbena. Chocolate and hazelnut choux pastry. and Orange jelly. Before we go, we are given a 
quick peek into the kitchen. Even in a 3 Michelin star restaurant, when it’s Eurocup time, the English have to watch. I also get a chance to talk with Chef Graham. He tells me he is against using 
A5 Wagyu and similar beef. He has a problem with the cow’s food. They need a lot of feed. And some of what they eat is food fit for humans. He believes in raising animals on 
feed that humans cannot consume. So it transforms those 
nutrients into food we can eat. And saving valuable resources 
suitable for human consumption. He is a man of principle. I like that. It’s almost time to say goodbye to The Ledbury. But first, the bill. Our total for today is 860 euro. But the gift from my wife 
took up a huge chunk of it. Thank you! So what are my final thoughts on The Ledbury? The service was flawless and precise. I really appreciated them 
surprising me with another dessert after I fumbled my phone into the first one. It gave us a funny moment. I really liked the chef's presence and energy, and how he created a very welcoming 
atmosphere in the dining area. I also enjoyed the high complexity of the dishes. I’m really happy I went. In my opinion, The Ledbury in London is 
a really good 3-Michelin-star restaurant and definitely worth a visit."

"It’s the WORLD’S #2 BEST Restaurant, but I SEE IT DIFFERENTLY - Asador Etxebarri",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak6Q1dPIs1s,"It’s been named the 2nd best restaurant in the world (World's 50 Best Restaurants list) and it’s renowned as the best grill restaurant, period. It's called Asador Etxebarri. It’s the brainchild of local chef Bittor Arguinzoniz.
You've probably seen some of the many articles and videos about this restaurant, claiming it to be one of the best in the world. 

Unfortunately, I beg to differ.

restaurant in the world and it’s renowned as the best 
grill restaurant, period. Getting a table is nearly impossible. The media loves it, and 
food bloggers drool over it. Even the late, great Anthony Bourdain said he 
wished to have his last meal on earth there. Despite the hype, the humble 
chef has admitted he hates   the press and would pay anything to be left alone. My expectations are sky-high. I have to admit, during this visit, there were a 
lot of questions that had me scratching my head. You've probably seen some of the many 
articles and videos about this restaurant, claiming it to be one of the best in the world. Unfortunately, I beg to differ. It takes us to Basque country in Northern Spain. It’s a country within a country, and it feels that way. We are on our way to a picturesque 
village of 1400 people. Called Axpe-Atxondo. It’s peaceful, beautiful and the perfect 
backdrop for our restaurant for today. Asador Etxebarri. The concept is simple. Serve the highest quality flame-grilled food. It’s the brainchild of local 
chef Bittor Arguinzoniz. He is a self-taught chef who has been 
described as having a Japanese mentality with an obsession for achieving perfection. He grew up around the corner, in a 
house without electricity or gas. Where his mother and grandmother would 
cook everything over an open fire. Carrying on tradition, Chef Bittor does the same. In his quest, he has invented many of 
the kitchen tools he uses on the grill, including a press that allows him to grill 
both sides of a steak at the same time. We are the first to arrive. With welcome drinks in hand, we scout out the best table 
to capture the atmosphere. The first thing I notice is the materials. Everything looks and feels like it 
was handmade by skilled artisans. Taking a quick look around, we 
stop to admire the wine cabinet. Looking over the list, we 
get some bread to snack on. The list has some wines 
that are super interesting,   but this bread really grabs my attention. Just look at that. Superb. For champagne, we start with a 
premier cru from Dhont-Grellet. But knowing that there will 
be steak on the menu and   they have a top selection of Spanish red wines, I started looking through the wine list. And then, this catches my eye. A heavy hitter. 1957 Vega Sicilia Unico gran reserva. It’s known by many to be the 
best winery in the country. At 2300 euros, it’s not cheap, but it’s something I probably won’t 
have the chance to ever try again. The wine is opened and 
allowed to breathe for a while because it has been in the bottle for a long time. so we will return to it later. On the menu are a la carte options and a 14-course tasting menu for 280 euro. Full table only. That means if one person orders the tasting menu, everyone else at the table needs to order it too. This happens at many Michelin-star restaurants, and for me it’s no problem. Getting a reservation is a problem. Because this place is so popular, 
getting one can take months. Here is our first appetizer. It’s one of Extebarri's most iconic 
creations, which has the internet raving. Chorizo. This is an interpretation of Joselito chorizo 
based on the traditional local recipe. After making a paste from chorizo peppers, Joselito Presa and Secreto are mixed 
in and it is left to rest for 24 hours. It is then stuffed into natural sausage 
skin and cured for several weeks. This was very tasty as a starter. In the world's best restaurants, meals 
always begin with an amuse-bouche. These are served both to prepare the guest for the 
meal and to offer a glimpse of the chef's style. Most of the time, they serve complex, flavor-rich 
bites prepared using various techniques. But here, they use one 
technique and one ingredient. Next is anchovy. Not the salt-cured kind. This one is marinated since it's in season. And then grilled. Simple, tasty and fresh. I love simple yet great things. High-quality ingredients, perfectly prepared. We move onto buffalo mozzarella cheese. This is an Etxebarri classic. The chef has his own herd of buffalo, and this cheese is made from 
fresh buffalo milk every morning. It’s served here with basil oil, and 
of course, it was a quality cheese. It's clear that the chef makes no compromises when it comes to the quality of the ingredients. In an interview, Bittor mentioned 
that he doesn't cook for these awards. And all this attention gives him stress 
because people expect more from them every day. The wait is over. It's time to taste the red wine. By some sort of miracle, this wine is almost 70 years old yet 
still young and fresh on the palette. I can see why Vega Sicilia 
has such a good reputation. I tell Mohamad, the sommelier, to definitely 
pour himself a glass of it as well. He is very grateful for it and wants 
to show us the next drinks as a gift. Here is the first one. Our next drink is a Spanish 
wine from producer Raul Perez. It’s made with Albariño grapes that 
are common here in northern Spain. It is paired with our next course. Grilled white asparagus with spring mushrooms. Asparagus is a very important 
ingredient in this region. This dish is a bit more complex and 
features a great flavor pairing. It’s a delicate yet flavorful dish that 
highlights the fresh, seasonal ingredients. They don't consider themselves 
as a fine dining restaurant. They say they are just a small house 
where you can get food and drinks. So it's no surprise that the 
service is quite different from what we have seen in other 
top restaurants around the world. They come out, say the name 
of the dish, and then leave. Not everyone speaks English, so sometimes 
we only hear the name in Spanish. I also have to pour my own 
water and sometimes my wine. They are kind and they smile, but 
this is a different kind of service. Next, razor clams with a pea sauce. Razor clams are a fascinating species. All because of their oversized foot. They use it to create thrust similar to squid. But its main purpose is to dig. Razor clams have adapted to become the 
fastest-digging clams on the planet. And for thousands of years, this skill helped 
them to escape being captured by us humans. Unfortunately for the razor 
clam, humans adapted too. At some point in the last century, we cracked the 
code and found a way to make the clam come to us. Salt And find a new home it does. In our bellies. Simple but beautiful presentation. I love it. The razor clams are perfectly tender. So far, I can tell you that the quality 
of the ingredients here is fantastic. Our next wine comes from one 
of my favorite wine regions. Chassange Montrachet. This is a 2021 chardonnay from Benoit Moreau. It’s paired with lobster. Flawlessly cooked and wonderfully 
tender, You can see how tender it is. Look at the size of these claws. One of the biggest I've ever seen. Imagine how large the lobster must have been. It was a tough claw to crack. Surprisingly, the lobster also goes 
really well with the 1957 Unico. Red wine and seafood don’t usually match. But here, they get along like 
Samwell Tarly and Jon Snow. It really shows the amazing 
versatility of this wine. Next, the perfect prawn from Palamos. The Palamos prawn is not to be confused with 
the other famous Spanish prawn, the Carabineros. Carabineros are a deep water prawn 
found mostly in the east Atlantic Ocean. They are the biggest prawns in the world, known 
for their bright red color and robust flavor. Gamba de Palamos, or Palamos prawns come from the 
northwest Mediterranean sea town of the same name. They live in a protected environment, are fished under strict, sustainable regulations and widely considered the best in the world. The next time your prawn is served with the head, you are in for a real treat. The head is actually full of gorgeous flavor, but there is a trick to getting at it. First, you need to hold the 
prawn firmly facing down. Then, twist off the body. The head acts like a cup 
and catches all the juices. This is the good stuff. All you need to do is suck it up. Brains and all. In many cultures, it’s considered the best part. This was high-quality prawn, 
perfectly cooked, and that's it. Next is baby octopus, artichoke and seaweed. The salty seafood goes well 
with the nutty artichoke. Here we have another delicacy from the sea. The sea urchin. Sea urchins are fascinating creatures as well. There are almost a thousand species of 
them and they come in all sorts of colors. And they are also one of the 
oldest species known to man. Their hard shell is covered with movable spines and they have five teeth 
that they use to scrape algae and other food from the rocks. Here we have it served in its shell. It is rich and creamy, with 
both sweet and savory flavors. Next is another course with simple ingredients. This is egg with St. George mushrooms. The egg is slowly grilled to this 
consistency and then mushrooms are added. Incredibly simple but delicious. Our next dish is hake. Specifically, the ‘cococha’ or cheeks, served 
on a crisp kale leaf with a dallop of aioli. This is the most exquisite part of 
the fish and is full of collagen. It had a melt-in-the-mouth quality I really liked. We received the next course, but the server didn't speak 
English, so they said in Spanish: guisantes lágrima a la brasa. At first glance, it looks like a bowl of peas. But these are not just any peas. These are tear drop peas. They are grown in the north and can 
cost upwards of 200 euro per kilo. Also known as green caviar, they are one of the world’s 
most time-sensitive vegetables. They can only be picked at dawn because 
the harsh sun destroys their delicate form. And they lose more than half 
their quality after only two days. That means transport from the orchard to 
the kitchen has to be done muy rápido. It’s one of the reasons for the high price tag. These precious peas are grilled, of 
course, and served in their own juice. It was extremely fresh and 
vibrant, and I enjoyed it. Next we have red snapper. First, they show it to us whole, 
then they slice and serve it. Perfectly grilled. The sauce is made using the gelatin 
from fish bones, oil, and garlic. Finally, we are presented with the main course. Meat lovers, feast your eyes on this.
Steak, with a simple green salad. Many people say that this 
is the best in the world. Do you see this? PERFECT! Supreme cut, perfect sear, gorgeous flavor and I really liked the taste of the aged beef. I've had many fantastic steaks in my life. In Japan, Argentina, and many other places. This was also a perfect steak. But to call it the best in the world? I don't think there is such a thing. With desserts coming up, Chef proves 
that he can grill just about anything. This is milk ice cream smoked 
on the grill with beet juice. It’s so good, I ask for another one. The combination of beetroot 
and ice cream was amazing. If you are off the sweets and working 
on your beach body, look away. This is black and white chocolate souffle. And with that, stick a fork in me. I’m done. Our total for today is 2860 euros for two. And now my final thoughts on Etxebarri. The story of this restaurant is very interesting. They say they are just a small house 
where you can get food and drinks, yet, there is still a huge 
hype around the restaurant. You have to wait months if you want to eat here. Nowadays, many restaurants put in a lot of effort 
to create an exciting story that draws people in. As I see it, in the case of Asador 
Etxebarri, it happened the other way around. Although, they didn’t ask for it, they got it, and it’s become larger than life. Why this particular restaurant 
gained so much attention, I don't know. And don’t get me wrong, chasing perfection 
is something that takes a lot of effort. I can't judge if this is 
the best grill restaurant. There are many places with good fish, 
good lobster, and good ingredients. And there are many places 
where they grill very well. But to me, a restaurant is not just about 
preparing an ingredient with one technique. For me, a good restaurant is a more complex thing. To dine here is pricey, and for 300 euros there are other places that   provide better service and a 
few more bells and whistles. At least for me. Apart from the hype and the 
contradictions around being the “best”, at the end of the day it’s a good restaurant. If you’re looking for a place to eat 
perfectly executed traditional dishes, you will certainly find it at Etxebarri. I wish Chef Bittor a long and successful career. To me, anyone who strives 
for perfection is a hero. and that does it for this episode. Thank you for joining me! If you like this video, hit subscribe! See you next time"

Not them. Them. Javier and Sergio. Both of them are chefs. After college, they go their separate 
ways, to learn as much as they could. Believing their combined 
knowledge would be amplified. One stays in Spain, and the other to the UK. Eventually they would reunite 
in Barcelona, join forces,   and take the Spanish culinary landscape by storm. In 2018, they open a restaurant, and by 
2022, they have all three Michelin stars. Nice story, isn't it? But does their restaurant live 
up to their incredible story? Today we will visit, Cocina Hermanos Torres. We are in Barcelona. In the laid back neighborhood of Les Corts. In this area, we can find 
the home of FC Barcelona. Where the greats like Ronaldinho, 
Neymar and Lionel Messi all played. This neighborhood is also home 
to our restaurant for today. Cocina Hermanos Torres. From the outside, you would never guess 
that it’s a 3 Michelin star restaurant. It actually used to be a warehouse 
and a former tire center. What kind of tires did they sell? I shouldn’t have to tell you. You guessed it. Michelin. The Michelin guide was first written in 1900,   to give car owners a reason 
to travel off the beaten path. Together with other tire makers,   brothers Édouard and André Michelin 
published a guide for French motorists. Nearly 35,000 copies of this first, free 
edition of the guide were distributed. It gave motorists maps, tire repair 
and replacement instructions,   listings for car mechanics, hotels, and petrol 
stations, and restaurants throughout France. It has since grown to be what many 
call the Bible of fine dining,   with a series of guides covering 45 countries. After selling tires and getting three stars, 
this place seems blessed by all things Michelin. Inside, the kitchen dominates 
the huge 800 square meter space. It feels like the movie set 
of a culinary colosseum. In the center is where all the action happens.
home of the culinary warriors,   armed with razor-sharp knives, 
and their only armour is an apron. Around it, the lucky 
spectators can enjoy the show. At the table, we find a 
beautiful contrast in the design. With comfortable chairs, elegant table settings   and white tablecloths really 
that warm up the atmosphere. We see more duality in the servers. Their formal blue suits are paired 
with bright red high top sneakers. Hopefully it’s a metaphor for the experience with 
classical service and a touch of playfulness. I love the concept. The shoes were made by Barcelona 
sportswear company Munich,   who created the exclusive shoes to celebrate 
the Hermanos Torres third Michelin star. The color is picked up in 
the flowers and the menu. I like the concept. I start noticing things in twos. On the base plate, the menu and with the flowers. Cocina Hermanos Torres means 
Torres Brothers Kitchen in Spanish. And no surprise, there are two of them. And they are twins. Our server shows the wine pairings. There are two options. One for 190 and the other is 350 euro. We also check out the wine list. It’s extensive with some heavy hitters. Including a 1996 Krug clos 
du Mesnil for 6500 euro. It’s tempting, but I choose the 
2nd tier wine pairing instead. Our welcome drink is prepared fresh at the table. It’s a refreshing blend of celery juice 
and cherry wine that has a kick to it. Not far behind is our amuse bouche. I love the little serving table 
and the bite has gorgeous textures. Pepper and smoked anchovy bonbon. Crispy steak tartar. And a sandwich with tomato and Iberian ham. Our first wine is a Chardonnay from Argentina. It’s a 2022 Zuccardi Botanico. Our first course makes me feel a 
sense of harmony just looking at it. It’s a fine dining version of surf and turf. Warm squid tartar with imperial 
beluga caviar in a cold chicken broth. Each ingredient has its own place in 
this dish and It’s wonderful together. The cold chicken broth is the most surprising,   because creating something so special from 
such a simple ingredient is very difficult. I like this elegant and modern vertical plating,   which allowed me to taste all 
the flavors in one spoonful. Homemade bread from white wheat and 
rye and olive oil from Catalonia. This is traditional Catalonian rustic bread, 
with thick crust and a dense spongy crumb. The sommelier called Azahara, is full of energy. It’s refreshing to see servers without 
pretense just being their authentic selves. She’s friendly, charming and seems to 
be having just as much fun as we are. This is my kind of service. For our next wine, she takes 
us to the northwest of Spain. It’s a 2022 Godello from producer Rafael Palacios. This wine is young and really crisp. Our second course is Galician crab,   a seaweed cracker and a broth made with 
the essence of king prawn and herbs. The whole thing is beautiful, 
like a modern painting. Nice textures with a complex mix of flavors. Sweet and briny, umami and herbal. Not as concentrated as I 
hoped, but still very good. A new sommelier arrives. She is Maria from Russia. Our relationship started off reserved, 
but it quickly opened up like a fine wine. Soon, we have her laughing 
and joking around as well. She pours our third wine. It’s a Savagnin from the Jura region of France. It’s smokey and buttery. We see more beautiful 
presentation in our third course. It’s white asparagus from Navarra, 
with mussels, saffron and tarragon. Asparagus is in season and it is perfect, and the saffron gives us a touch of exotic flavor. It’s an outstanding dish, and 
I really enjoy the geometry. I like the visual presentation of the dishes. It’s a seasonal dish and a lot of 
thought and work went into this. The pace is strong, and overall, 
this meal has been fantastic so far. Azahara is back and admits she just found out   from another table that I had 
a fine dining YouTube channel. It doesn’t change her behaviour one bit. You can’t upgrade the maximum! Look at her behavior before 
and after she found out. No change at all. That's what a true professional is like. They always give their best. That's what perfectionism is. She gives us a smile and tells us it 
should get us to 10 million subscribers. I love it. Speaking of subscribing, If you 
haven’t done so yet, go for it. Hit that button if you haven’t already,   and we will do our best to give 
you more smiles like this one. Next to the table is one of 
Spain’s most famous ingredients. Maresme green peas. They are a highly prized variety of green 
peas from the Maresme region in Catalonia. It is also known as the green pearl. They have a short growing season, 
from March to May, so we are in luck. They share the plate with tapioca pearls, 
fried bread and Iberian ham sauce. Here, the rich, salty ham sauce enhances 
the fresh, sweet flavor of the peas. The tapioca prolongs the flavors. I love the simplicity here. Bread, ham and peas. We told the server that we 
really enjoyed this dish, and they asked if we'd like another one! It reminds me of 2010 when I took 
my mother to Verona to see Turandot, and the tenor sang Nessun Dorma twice. Our next wine is from the Campania 
wine region in southern Italy. It’s a 2021 Fiorduva from producer Marisa Cuomo. It’s their top wine with an average 
critic score of 95 out of a hundred. It has a gentle creaminess 
but with a lively acidity. We are halfway through the savory dishes. Next is roasted and grilled eel with 
pickled kohlrabi, and citrus essence. I wasn’t crazy about the presentation 
or the taste of this one. Our next wine is another Italian selection. This time from Sicily, from ‘Triple 
A’ producer Arianna Occhipinti. It’s their highly-rated 2021 Frappato. It’s paired with traditional cod stew, 
spicy chorizo gnocchi and cured lemon. I expected chunks of cod but I was 
surprised to see them use codfish tripe. Using Codfish tripe in a 3 
Michelin star restaurant?   I really enjoy this interesting choice. It’s a jelly-like ingredient 
with a distinctive texture. It came with a fine emulsion, and 
the chip on top was excellent. The next wine is a 2017 Valbuena 
from producer Vega Sicilia. Widely regarded as the greatest 
wine producer in Spain. This one is a Tempranillo. The taste of wood suits it well. It was chosen specially for our first main course. Suckling pig, with tamarind and plum. This dish was not on our menu, 
but they wanted us to try it. At this moment, I didn't know 
how grateful I would soon be. This is one of the most 
delicious pork dishes of my life, there's no question about it. The crispy skin, the gorgeous texture of the 
pork, and the powerful flavor of the jus. In the fine dining world, pork is 
not often used for main courses. You often see pigeon or lamb 
dishes, but rarely pork. Another Catalonian wine is next. It’s the 2004 Gratallops. This one comes from Priorat, a small wine region that shot 
to fame in the past few decades thanks to its intense, full-bodied red wines. It’s paired with our final savory course. Cured lamb with zucchini and a sauce 
of mint and black garlic emulsions. The lamb is cured for one month 
and it is absolutely perfect. The last pork dish set the bar so high 
that, unfortunately, the lamb fell short. Even if it was also a wonderful dish. Savory courses done, now it’s time for dessert. The patisserie has its own 
space in the restaurant, which looks out onto the main room and covers 100% of the sweet, bread, 
chocolate and dessert service. Our first is a foam made with 
yogurt, green tea matcha and citrus. With a shiso leaf on top. Very fresh, clean and delicious. Azahara pours us a sweet wine from Spain. A 2014 Castell d'Encus Majjan 
made with Semillon grapes. It’s fresh, complex and 
beautiful to continue with. Next we meet one half of the dynamic duo. It’s Javier Torres. He and his twin brother Sergio were 
inspired by their grandmother Catalina who was a chef at the homes 
of Barcelona’s wealthy. They joined forces in 2002 and invented a 
piece of cooking technology in partnership with the Polytechnic university of Valencia. It’s called the Gastrovac. Sergio worked with Alain Ducasse 
in Paris before joining his brother to open the Dos Cielos restaurant 
at the Meliá Barcelona Sky hotel. Here they made a name for themselves 
as a duo, and earned a Michelin star. The twins went on to release several books,   their own TV show, cook for a cruise 
line, and create a menu for an airline. To this day, they are one of only 4 
restaurants in Barcelona with three stars. And the only one to receive the Michelin 
green star for operating a zero waste kitchen. Something both chefs are passionate about. Our next dessert is strawberries, 
white vinegar and elderflower. It’s the beginning of strawberry season 
here and these are as fresh as they come. The elderflowers are wild and are 
picked by staff around Barcelona. This is a simple dish designed 
to bring back childhood memories. A quick tour of the wine cellar, and 
then it’s time for our last wine. At 21.5 percent, it’s more of a liquor, 
but it’s balanced by high levels of sugar. It’s a dessert by itself. Our next dessert is called the cocoa age. It’s made with the pulp of the cocoa 
and inside is white chocolate ice cream. Next, we go behind the scenes with a tour. The brothers also have a YouTube 
channel with a dedicated place to film. Finally, we are shown to a secret place next door. It’s a place to enjoy a fine 
cigar and relax with a drink. It’s back to the main building 
with our last dessert. Orange Blossom made with the peel of the orange. The petit fours bid us farewell. Here we have: Yuzu marshmallow. Lemon and poppy mini cake. Dark chocolate dragee. Passion fruit profiterole. And black sesame ice pearl. And that concludes a wonderful 
meal at Cocina Hermanos Torres. Our total for today is 940 euros for two. What can I say about Cocina Hermanos Torres? This is one restaurant 
experience with a happy ending. It was a huge surprise from the 
moment I walked in the door. The layout and atmosphere are unique. The kitchen is beautiful. you don't 
see something like this every day. The staff are industry experts who delivered 
a master class on truly great service. And last but not least, the menu was brilliant. The Torres twins are a dynamic duo who creatively tackle traditional Spanish cuisine and shape it in their own character. Proving that two heads 
actually are better than one. I already have my next 
reservation, and I cannot wait. and that does it for this episode Thank you for joining me! If you like this video, hit subscribe! See you next time."

3 MICHELIN STAR Restaurant Review with Romanée-Conti by the Glass (€3000/Bottle),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7PjSXobbAU,"Do you know the world-famous beauty brand Shiseido?

I ate at the LEGENDARY Chef's Restaurant - Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l36UwRlslUg,"In this video, we visit the Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester.
He was the first chef to have 3 restaurants with 3 michelin stars at the same time.
Today, he is the second most decorated chef in the world with 21 stars.
His name and fine dining go hand in hand. 

The question is: 
With so many restaurants, is it possible to maintain the quality at such a high level?
Or is it just his name slapped on the sign?

Check out my restaurant: 
https://www.instagram.com/42restaurant/",2024-03-17T17:00:03Z,"['https://www.instagram.com/alexandertheguest', 'https://www.instagram.com/42restaurant/']",6dzoofWOmog,"Today we are heading to 
Cumbria, in North West England. Where natural beauty is front and center. It’s a hard place to reach, but totally worth it. It’s a land of lakes, castles, 
coastline, and breathtaking scenery Almost like it’s frozen in time. So it’s fitting that we are off to a 
former 13th century blacksmith shop to sample the cuisine where the 
only thing imported is the name. Join us for 15 courses at L’Enclume. We arrive in Cartmel.
A medieval lovers dream. Nesselled on the edge of 
the English Lake district,   it’s a hidden gem with a population 
of just under 5000 people. Little English towns always bring 
me back to my days as an Au Per. As a fresh faced Hungarian in my 20’s, 
coming here was an exciting adventure. in many ways shaped the person I am today. Like everything in this sleepy 
town, L’Enclume is easy to find. From the outside, it looks untouched. For many many years it was 
a family blacksmith shop dating back to the 13th century. And every effort was made to keep 
much of that history in tact. The anvil on the door tells 
us we are in the right place. L’Enclume is French for 
Anvil which is a nice touch. Inside the restaurant, much 
of the history has been saved. That explains the design and the decor, 
using wood, metal and stone throughout. The furniture is simple but functional 
and borrows from Nordic design. Everything is custom made using Cumbria oak 
by a local furniture maker in nearby Kendall. Although it’s minimal, they manage to create a 
welcoming atmosphere with some elegant touches. Dining with me today are some 
friends from the music industry. We met throught this channel and we 
get together when I come to England. The menu here at L’Enclume is a 15 course 
tasting menu for just under 300 euro. For wine, there are three pairings starting with the taster pairing for 115 euro. Getting more exclusive, we have 
the signature pairing for 175
   and only the best wines in each region make it onto the select pairing for 340 euros Which what we will have today. But first, champagne. There is a surprising champagne by the glass here. The Jacque Selosse Grand Cru Brut Initial This is a special blend of three 
vintages limited to 33,000 bottles. It is world-class, and our first 
pick to kick off this dinner. Our first little appetiser arrives. It’s a tartlet of Carmelized 
and dehydrated beetroot, Raw ribbons of beetroot with edible flowers and It comes with a little chaser of 
beetroot juices infused with perilla oil. It’s super fresh and popping with flavor. Our next bite is a pork belly and smoked 
eel fritter with a puffed onion tapioca. Under it is a lovage emulsion and on top is 
fermented sweetcorn puree and lovage cress Another strong opener. The Jacques Selosse was nice but 
there is always room for Krug. This is an oh three. This vintage was disgorged in 2012 which means this champagne has been untouched and developing beautifully 
in the bottle for 11 years. Our next course is a savoury cheese 
pudding caramelised in birch sap, then topped with stout vinegar jelly 
and grated aged Berkswell cheese. Lovely contrasting textures. And the vinegar jelly gave it a nice acidic kick. If you like amazing food like this 
as much as I do, hit subscribe. It would help us a lot. Thank you! Our next wine is from the 
Vouvray region in France. It’s a 2012 Chenin Blanc Clos 
du Bourg from Domaine Huet. Next course is Langousitine 
from the west coast of Scotland. Served uncooked, cut in Japanese style 
rounds and rolled in fig leaf ash. Over the top is a Buttermilk 
sauce with smoked pike perch roe. It might not look like it, but this 
dish was in a league of its own. Perfectly balanced, bold flavors. Best in class. Coming up is Orkney scallop 
brushed with homemade EXO sauce Under it is Crown Prince squash and rosemary oil. Sauce is made from the flowers of nasturtium. The scallop is ultra delicate, and this 
sauce is concentrated and delicious. Another powerful dish. Although the scallops come from the Orkney 
Islands off the northern tip of Scotland,
   everything else is grown on Chef Rogan’s farm. Nicknamed Our Farm. More than 90 percent of the plants 
used in the menu come from here. A dish starts with the Head Grower of the farm 
choosing what’s at it’s peak in the garden. The ingredients are then 
discussed with the senior team and they go to work in the development kitchen. The chosen dishes then make their 
way onto the menu at L’Enclume. It started because they couldn’t get the 
quality they wanted at the grocery store. and has grown to define the 
mission and values of the company,   with farm to fork being the main feature. The idea is to strengthen the 
relationship between cooking and growing. Our next wine is a 2019 
Trebbiano d’Abruzzo from Italy.
   Made by Triple A producer Emidio Pepe. This wine really showcases the terroir 
and has made Pepe a legend in the region. Up next is Pink Fir Apple potatoes gently 
cooked in chicken fat and pickled walnut. The sauce is based on Parkhouse 
cheddar from the North Lakes split with an oil from burnt onion ash. On the side is pumpernickle rye bread Really creative dish here with a lot happening. Another fabulous effort from 
Chef Rogan and the team. Chef Rogan and his wife Penny 
opened L’Enclume in 2002. They received the first Michelin star in 2005, a second star in 2013, and its third star in 2022. They currently hold the number one 
spot in the UK Good Food Guide. Since opening L’Enclume, they have 
built a little empire in town. They have another restaurant 
just a short walk away and have rooms for rent for 
those wanting to stay overnight. The power couple have also opened 
restaurants in Hong Kong, London and Malta. Although Chef Rogan has seen a lot of success, 
his beginnings were far less glamorous. He got his start in the kitchen at a 
Greek restaurant cooking kebabs and chips. From there he took an apprentice role   under Savoy-trained chef Paul 
Norman at Rhinefield House. He went on to work for 8 years 
at different restaurants. Moving forward, he landed jobs 
with Marco Pierre White and   John Burton-Race who urged him to go to France. This led to three Michelin 
star Lucas Carton in Paris. And later to his first head chef 
role at Adlington Place in Croydon. While in France, there is a good chance Chef Rogan 
tried this at one time or another. Drappier Champagne. Next in our wine pairing is 
this 2012 Grande sendree. Our sommelier has chosen it 
specifically for the next dish. It’s seaweed custard, served with beef 
broth infused with bone marrow fat, Topped with L’Enclume’s blend 
of caviar and Maldon oysters. It seems the kitchen is pulling out all the stops. This is as good as seafood gets. This is Masuizumi Private reserve from 2018. This sake is aged in barrels 
used to make Burgundy. The result is a delicious combination. For sure Japanese philosophy is 
a big influence on Chef Rogan. According to the man himself, the development of the L’Enclume 
menu is inspired by ingredients that change with the seasons, and ensure a truly traceable 
dining experience philosophy. We also know that Chef Rogan is 
influenced by French chef Marc Veyrat, who creates avant-garde, natural cuisine 
and uses mountain herbs and flowers. Back at the table, our server 
teases us with a little lamb. This will be our main course later. But for now, we have salt baked artichokes,
cooked in brown butter, with Welsh truffle. The broth is infused with roast chicken, 
carmelized artichokes and truffle. It’s earthy and aromatic thanks to the truffle, and the sauce is a hearty base with lots of depth. What really comes through is the brown butter. Brown butter is one ingredient we 
come across a lot on this channel. It’s a staple in French cuisine but is 
also used in kitchens all over the world. Making it is easy. Take a stick of unsalted butter. Add it to a sauce pan Bring it to a simmer over medium-high heat. When it starts to bubble, turn your 
heat down and keep stirring it. In just a few minutes, it will turn 
golden brown with a nutty smell. Transfer to a heatproof bowl and you’re finished. Use your new super ingredient 
wherever you use regular butter. It’s great in baked goods, and as we just tasted it’s amazing on roasted vegetables. We wanted more champagne. I told the guys that We should try a 2006 
Charles Heidsieck Blanc de Millenaires, because it's a beautiful bottle and worth trying. and it brings out a very nice umami. Our next course is West Coast Monkfish 
tail served on top of King oyster mushroom,   and topped with carmelized red baron onions. The sauce is an oyster mushroom and yellow wine. This is a happy accident. The champagne gods couldn’t have 
chosen a more fitting champagne. They complemented each other's 
flavors astonishingly well. The umami in the dish was 
amplified by the champagne. To go with our main course, we have a 2002 
Saintsbury reserve California Pinot noir. This wine is super lively for its age 
and I can’t wait to try it with the lamb. That would be dry aged Herdwick 
lamb loin and yellow pea puree Spooned on top we have a sauce 
infused with fennel vinegar and fermented yellow beans and tapioca With it comes a lamb fat crumpet so 
we don’t miss a drop of the sauce. It doesn’t happen often, 
but I’m at a loss for words. To call this amazing would be an understatement. So far, this menu feels like the 
first 6 seasons of Game of Thrones. I just really hope it doesn’t turn 
into the seventh and eighth ones! With the main courses over, we 
are invited for a little tour. There is tons of positive energy here. I love it. Desserts are next, led by 
a Hungarian dessert wine. This is a Tokaji Aszu from Berecs Stephanie
Ultra smooth and sweet. Our first dessert is frozen Tunworth cheese, malt crumb, berries and lemon thyme jelly. Savory and sweet with cheese-like 
ice cream and then the sweet berries. Excellent texture, mildly sweet, pure genius. They follow it up with 
concord pears with rosehips,  Pear mousee, meadowsweet sorbet and sugar wafer. Also really good, but much sweeter. Our final dessert is a signature 
that pays tribute to the past. It’s called The Anvil Caramelized Pink Lady apples and 
custard with a caramel mousse flavored with a housemade miso. And covered in an apple and spruce sauce. Another banger. We are in the home stretch now, 
starting with a cheese service. Here we have farmhouse cheeses 
from all over the british isles. Eleven of them, including 
goats, blue, hard and soft. Finally, the petit fours. A peach ice cream mini cone.  A carmelized quince tartlet
A kendal mint cake stone  And finally a chocolate 
bonbon with pine cone praline. A beautiful finish to a great meal. Our total for 5 people is just over 6700 euros. So let's summarize my experience at lenclume. The wine pairing. For the magnitude of these amazing dishes, I would 
have gladly tried a more serious wine pairing. I was told that there is no demand for 
bigger wines here in the countryside. In terms of service, it was 
flawless and professional. I will remember the service team 
as kind, attentive and sensible. We were quite hard to serve in our little room, but they managed it perfectly. This menu was a true experience,   like sitting behind a Formula 1 driver 
as he speeds along the racetrack. It was intense, brave, modern and unique. I really liked the plating too. Every course had strong characteristics 
and was deeply connected to the chef. In terms of dishes and tastes, it 
was similar to my days as an Au Per. A defining experience in my life. This is my favorite Kitchen in the UK and 
this menu is one of my favorites of all time. And that does it for this episode. Thank you for joining me. If you like this video, hit subscribe! See you next time."

https://www.instagram.com/42restaurant/",2024-03-03T17:00:43Z,"['https://ynyshir.co.uk/', 'https://www.instagram.com/alexandertheguest', 'https://www.instagram.com/42restaurant/']",oILLtojoY7Q,"There is a DJ setting the 
party mood at full volume. The servers are relaxed and informal. And the menu is 30 courses of meat. Shut up and take my money. Join me and find out as we head 
to Wales to check out Ynyshir. It’s morning in London. We pack the car and hit the road. For a good 5 hour drive. Which gives me time to learn 
about where we are going. The restaurant is inside Snowdonia National Park. It’s the largest national park in 
Wales, and home to over 25000 people. But a lot more come to visit each year. More than 4 million people come here to explore 
its towering peaks and breathtaking valleys. It’s a place steeped in 
culture, history and heritage and where Welsh language can be heard every day. I love tradition, and it sounds like 
this place couldn’t get more traditional. The restaurant is called Ynyshir. It was recommended to me, but 
I don’t know much about it. From the website, they tell us 
what to expect straight away. A DJ playing music and the theatre 
of the kitchen taking centre stage. Expect fire, intense world flavours and the 
best meat and fish from around the globe. They tell us it’s not the best place for a 
business meeting or an intimate first date,   but perfect for that exciting second one! They don’t cater for diet 
restrictions and no substitutions. We must arrive for dinner at 5pm. and allow 4 to 5 hours for the dining experience. Sounds confident! Who is the chef behind this? His name is Gareth Ward. He was born and raised in Durham, England, 
and started his journey into cooking at 16. His CV includes Michelin star restaurants   like Hambleton Hall and Restaurant Sat 
Bains before taking over here in 2013. After just one year, he got his own Michelin star, but In 2016, he created a totally new concept. A restaurant that would be ingredient led, 
flavor driven, fat fuelled and protein obsessed. With a dream to be a food destination that 
brings in visitors from around the world. In 2022, Ynyshir became the first restaurant 
in Wales awarded 2 Michelin stars. And in 2023 was named Britain’s best 
restaurant at the National Restaurant Awards. Arriving at the gates, 
there is a bit of confusion. Our taxi driver seems to think 
the restaurant is this way. Lucky for us we don’t listen to him. RSBP stands for Royal Society 
for the Protection of Birds. We find our way to the restaurant. The vibe here definitely says “man cave” An open fire roaring outside. And inside lots of dark wood, 
leather, fur, skulls and football. and of course, tunes pumping. We can also see some history. This was first built as a 
farmhouse in the 15th century. Although it was renovated many times, it 
still has that old world character and feel. Our waiter arrives and gets 
us excited for the menu, which is split into two parts. First, fish and seafood. Starting with Japanese influence,   then more full-bodied dishes, 
and finally with Southeast Asian. Then it’s onto meat. Going from light to heavy with poultry 
first and finishing with red meat. It’s a total of 30 courses for 450 euro. They don’t do wine pairing here, but most of the 
wine on the wine list can be done by the glass. I see some nice stuff here. Not a lot of heavy hitters, but 
this is a list I can work with. Next, I check out my room, complete 
with a little piece of nature. There are 7 rooms in the house like 
this, and they go for 350 euro per night. In the garden there are a few newly 
built rooms with more space and privacy. One of those will set you back 800 euro. Our dinner starts here. With a look at what’s to come. Our first appetiser is mixed in front 
of us and served at a nearby table. It’s called Not French Onion. It’s a take on the classic 
soup with Japanese inspiration including nori seaweed and miso broth 
but with the added touch of goose liver. Interesting combination and 
absolutely full of flavor. Then we move. The tunes are really rocking now, and 
we get a chance to stop by the DJ booth. The resident DJ tells us he puts together a custom 
set every night and it’s never the same set twice. I wish you could hear The 
Passenger by Iggy Pop right now. It’s totally setting a party mood. Already, I’m having fun.
We are shown to our table. Right in front of the kitchen. It feels like the chef's table. The first bite is seabream. Japanese inspiration is there 
and they use fresh wasabi, but they are not faking Japan. For drinks I start with old faithful. Krug Grand Cuvee 171. Sometime, I just don't need surprises. Up next is yellowtail tuna with toasted 
sesame oil, white soy sauce, wasabi and nori. It’s really good with this Leclerc 
Briant Abyss Brut Zero from 2017. This is a vintage champagne made from 
the 2017 harvest, bottled in 2018,   disgorged in 2021 and submerged in the ocean 
off the coast of Brittany the same year. It was brought up from the depths 
of the ocean after 11 months. Whether you buy into the idea 
of submarine wine or not,   this champagne is excellent 
and has the awards to prove it. Next we have tuna belly with teriyaki sauce. The fish is beautifully buttery and the 
sauce has a wonderful savory sweet kick. This is a bluefin tuna with 
rice and black truffle. Lots going on here, and the 
tuna really takes a backseat. This had some spice to it that stayed with 
me well after they took away the plate. I mean, the rock. Next, another bluefin, this one 
with olive, jalapeno and yogurt. Just look at all that fat. It melts into an amazing umami flavor on contact. Delicious. It’s time to move on to the 
full-bodied part of the fish courses. The first is Spanish prawn with wild garlic. Really nice smoky flavor with a sweetness to it. The sauce is gorgeous with 
well integrated flavors. Next is Orkney scallop. Almost raw, just lightly grilled on one side. The sauce is made from 
scallop and A5 wagyu beef fat. It’s sweet, creamy but needs 
a bit more acid for me. Still it’s a really good one. Atlantic black cod served in a pork 
fat miso sauce topped with N25 caviar. Three bold players all fighting for attention. Interesting and creative dish. With it I enjoy an Austrian 
riesling by Nikolaihof. This one is the Fass Severin 
and it’s certified biodynamic. On the way to the washroom I find myself in a 
little pocket with comforts from the real world. Football and snacks. Proving you can take the man out of Newcastle, but you can’t take Newcastle out of the man. Next dish is Thai green curry. Made with shrimp caught in the 
waters just behind the restaurant. Powerful. Pop your eyes out acidity. I really enjoy this one. Next, lobster tail. It’s served raw with a coriander 
and Thai dipping sauce. The sauce has lots of punch with 
salty, sweet, spicy and sour happening. So far, there have been 
some hiccups in the service. Some longer wait times for things here. A wet napkin there. but what they lack in experiece, they make 
up for with enthusianism and dilligence. I'm sure, it's hard to find highly trained 
servers out here at the end of the world. I'm not too worried about these little mistakes. This atmosphere, the music, makes me 
really feel like I’m at a house party. and I’m too busy having a good time. Next is lobster claw in satay sauce. It’s served with peanut 
brittle and fresh lime zest. The lobster is firm but tender, and the 
sauce has bold flavors with sweet undertones. For wine we try something interesting. This wine is from French producer Dopff. It’s an aromatic wine that 
smells a lot like lychee. And it’s perfectly matched for our last 
spicy dish inspired by Southeast Asia This is Singapore chili crab served 
with a steamed bun that is deep fried. The crab is good with nice acidity 
and spice but this bun nice and soft. Very good. As we go from seafood to meat, 
we first need a palette cleanser. This shaved ice made from pickled ginger juice. It’s really nice and it works like a charm. Do you like what you see so far? If you do please make sure you hit subscribe. So you never miss the boat on a future episode. Our first meat dish is deep fried veal sweet 
bread with ranch topped with N25 caviar. This was excellent. Big flavors thanks to lots of fat. This is duck liver ice cream. It’s served with apple in syrup and fresh form along with puffed spelt and a spelt biscuit. Grated over the top is smoked veal. It’s salty, it’s sweet and 
plays with a ton of textures. With this we try Brannland’s Apple Ice 21 vintage. This is a still ice cider but 
it’s as sweet as any dessert wine. As you may have noticed by now, the menu has been 
fat fuelled and protein obsessed, as advertised. As much as I like a nice cut of meat, a few vegetables would be 
nice to lighten things up. But I’m not going to hold my breath. This is pigeon in a cheriaki sauce with chocolate. Cheriyaki is a teriyaki 
flavored with cherry and garlic. This one is really interesting. I still remember the amazing flavor combination. Very tender, exploding with flavor, I just wish it was pre-sliced 
so I could focus on it more. What did not distract me from this dish was wine. I didn’t have any. Our next dish is duck made Chinese style. Cooked for 24 hours and then 
made crispy with hot oil. On the side a classic garnish 
sliced cucumber and sweet onion. And over the top is a traditional 
Chinese Barbeque sauce. For wine we go with a 2017 California Pinot Noir. Traditional Thai salad with duck and pigeon This is lamb spare rib cooked 
low and slow for 36 hours. Then seared and charred over birch wood. and brushed with a mint soy glaze. Topped with shallots and fresh mint. It tastes as good as it looks We have to get our hands dirty, 
but it’s totally worth it. Outstanding. Next is sirloin with shiitake 
mushrooms cooked in beef fat. Over the top is a duck liver custard. Super rich, super flavorful. Nicely executed dish. At this point, the DJ has shifted gears. Gone are the likes of Iggy 
Pop and the Rolling Stones. Now we are into high-octane dance 
music and the speakers are cranked. This next one is a bit strange First they put this down in front of us. This is like McDonald’s with a Michelin twist. The one-bite burger is A5 
Japanese beef with fixings. The dessert is ice cream with caviar and syrup. I liked both of them but the 
presentation came out of nowhere. Next we have desserts. This is yorkshire rhubarb with duck 
liver custard and topped with spelt. The light tart rhubarb and the rich, heavy 
custard make a surprisingly nice couple and move quite well together. Finally a date cake with vanilla 
ice cream and traditional miso made with Japanese soy beans. It’s not as sweet as it 
looks, but was really good. The ice cream is excellent quality. Then, just as we are finishing. This happens. I thought something had caught fire for a second. Then I saw this and now ALL of the lights are going. Amazing. It totally fits the personality of this place. What a way to finish. When it’s time to go, we pick up the bill. As we pre-paid for our meals and 
accomodation this bill is just the drinks. Which comes to just over 1200 euro. I had an absolute blast here. The DJ and the house party atmosphere 
really makes this place a joy. My front row seat was the perfect 
place to watch chef Ward do his thing. The chef cooks with freedom. However I missed the vegetables and the freshness, and felt the menu was too one-sided. That said, they delivered on what was promised. On the service side, I see room for improvement. At times, the wait was a bit much, and 
my glass stayed empty for too long. But they are enthusiastic. And that’s the beauty of it. They are just doing what they love. Chef Ward told me that he wants to have a 
restaurant where even he would gladly dine. With the fire, the protein, the party, and even 
a bit of football, it seems like he has done it. When I told him I was going to be honest, and mention the small mistakes in this video, Chef Ward told me: “I’m glad you were here, but I’m 
not really interested in the video. I’m not sure if I’ll watch it. Say what you have to say.” He was smiling and he added: ""I don't give a f***"" I love this man and his honesty. Chef, in case you’re watching, I hope you like it. On New Year’s Eve in Dubai, I had a 
chance to chat with Chef Bjorn Franzen. We were talking about what 
was important in a restaurant and Bjorn shared his number one. A restaurant should be fun. Ynyshir was fun indeed. This fun place full of honest people? Absolutely. I for one, am going to miss them. And that does it for this episode Thank you for joining me, if you like this video, hit subscribe! See you next time."

Japan for six years running. That means getting a reservation 
is gonna be a pain in the ketsu, if you catch my drift. Say hello to Tokyo. It’s a city of extremes. With 37 million people, it’s the 
world’s largest city by population. If you think New York never sleeps, you should try this place. When it comes to food, you 
cannot do much better than Tokyo. There are more options here than 
you can shake a chopstick at. And more michelin star restaurants 
than anywhere else on earth. For me, it’s a tough decision. There are so many great choices here But today, I will not be 
using Michelin as my guide. I’m using the Japenese restaurant 
and food guide called Tabelog. The ratings come from Japanese 
customers, not inspectors. And since we’ve come so far, it only 
makes sense to go straight to number one. In the top spot is a place called 
Nihonbashi Kakigara-cho Sugita. Or just Sugita for short. This is Takaaki Sugita. He’s the owner and Itamae, or head sushi chef. The inspiration came in high school when he got hooked on a TV drama about a guy who becomes an 
apprentice at a sushi restaurant. It pushed him to take a 
part-time job as an apprentice, and there he spent the next 12 years! Working on his knife skills and learning 
Edomai sushi from the inside out. It’s the traditional Tokyo style sushi 
that dates back to the 19th century. It features small servings of fresh fish 
or seafood on top of small beds of rice. So after apprenticing for 12 
years, something amazing happened. His boss threw him the keys 
to one of his restaurants. It was Sugita’s to run. And he did just that for the next 10 years. After a decade of running 
his own spot, he was ready. At the age of 40, he took over the restaurant 
owned by his wife’s family and made it his own. The name would come from his surname Sugita. To not confuse it with other Sugita restaurants, he added the name of the neighborhood Nihonbashi Kakigaracho. It was an instant hit. In 2017 he got the first Michelin star, In 2022, the second one. But in the latest Michelin guide for Japan, 
you cannot find this restaurant anywhere. The fine dining community is buzzing 
about it all over the internet. And it seems the reason is because 
of how difficult it is to get a seat. Reservations are taken on a monthly basis and open up the first Monday of each month. And they do it the old-fashioned way by phone. Most of the seats are taken by regulars, and if you know one of them, this is 
the best way to get a reservation. This is how I got here. Kentaro “Henry” Nakahara. Henry is a chef and restaurant owner with a grilled meat restaurant and 
a burger place here in Tokyo. He eats at Sugita every month. If you don’t know a regular, then a well-tipped 
concierge from a luxury hotel is your best bet. And the best way to catch the newest Alexander 
the Guest episodes is to be a subscriber. If you haven’t done that yet, go for it. It will help us a lot. Reservations at Sugita are so 
low in supply and high in demand, it’s created it’s own black market. People have paid up to 2000 euros just 
to get a seat at Sugita-san’s counter. But don’t get any sneaky ideas. You need to bring your ID to prove you’re you. And if they catch you scalping your reservation, you will never get another one. All of this funny business with reservations was 
likely a turnoff for the Michelin inspectors. And they simply dropped the 
restaurant from the guide. Which is not uncommon here in Japan. Two other famous sushi places had a similar fate when they kept reservations 
away from the general public. Sushi Saito is one. The other is Sukiyabashi Jiro. This is where Obama famously went. You might remember it from the 2011 
documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi. Let’s forget about Michelin and other 
restaurants and get back to Sugita. All you really need to know is 
they won a boatload of awards and have been ranked number one 
sushi restaurant six years running. If you manage to get yourself a reservation, 
there are some rules you need to follow. They are listed on the website, 
but let me paraphrase for you. First one is no surprise. Dress up a bit. No shorts, flip-flops, jerseys, 
or other casual clothes, and for god’s sake, take your hat off. And save your sprays. No strong fragrances are allowed. You gotta go with the flow. If you have a long list of 
allergies OR food dislikes, your reservation might be refused. Because more than 15 minutes late means no sushi for you. Your reservation will be cancelled. Finally put your phone away. We had to ask permission very very nicely. From the outside, you would 
not know this place was famous. In fact, you would likely walk right by it. Sugita is well hidden on a quiet side street. There are no G-Wagons or Aston Martins 
outside to give it away either. Only the chef’s humble Honda 
scooter waits for his return. Entering through the curtains, it opens up into a cozy but welcoming space. It has a minimalist design which is no 
surprise for a traditional Japanese restaurant. An elegant counter made of 
hinoki wood is ready for action. And in front, space for 9 lucky people, each with a front row seat. If you want a more private experience, 
there is also a side room for four people. That’s a total of 13 seats. Once inside, we steady ourselves 
for the best sushi in the world. 5 to 8 bite size appetizers and 11 or 
12 pieces of nigiri sushi are coming. All this for 340 euros. Before the show, we see the staff working hard to make sure 
everything is perfect and ready to go. Here we see a sous chef grating 
wasabi root to go with tonight’s meal. Wasabi root is insanely 
expensive for a good reason. It is near impossible to grow. It needs shade, rich soil 
that is moist but not wet, and steady temperatures between 9 and 16 degrees. It’s grows naturally in river valleys in 
Japan, South Korea and parts of Russia. That means most of the 
world’s wasabi is imitation. The green stuff in those little packs is horseradish, mustard, food coloring 
and a tiny amount of wasabi dust. Fun fact about grating wasabi root. First of all, the top of the 
board must be made of shark skin. And grating should be done 
with an inward movement, because inward means balance. The meal begins with some snacks. This is like the opening act and we really 
see the chef show off his knife skills. And THAT is a knife. Here Sugita-san is preparing our first dish. Braised abalone. It’s a type of sea snail. It’s also known as sea ears. And that makes sense. It’s buttery and salty and has the chewiness 
of calamari but the texture more like scallop. It has nice earthy umami flavors. As you can see, everything is 
done with beautiful precision. Every slice, every motion, 
it’s mesmerizing to watch. And you can tell Sugita-san has done 
this hundreds of thousands of times. Up next is surf clam. This is found in northern Japan 
and can live more than 30 years. Even the clams live a long healthy life here! You’ve probably seen this before. The Japanese traditional way 
of fixing glass and pottery. They use lacquer to put it back together And decorate the break with 
gold,silver or platinum. They do this to highlight the 
special event in its history. It’s called kintsugi. It’s not a quick fix. The process can take up to three months. It’s part of the Japanese philosophy 
of accepting what’s not perfect. It reminds us that we will 
all be broken at some point. But not to give up. These events become scars in our lives. And we shouldn’t try to hide them. The chef’s is preparing his signature maki roll. Each piece was a party of 
textures with crisp seaweed paper, soft rice, the delicate crunch of 
fresh chives and ultra tender sardine. Together with the fresh wasabi and salty soy 
they created a beautiful harmony of flavors I understand why it’s a signature dish. It was incomparable. Next we have sea urchin and salmon roe We also try monkfish liver with hinotori sake Sugita has 30 different kinds of 
sake here, from all over Japan. Without question only the best 
quality ever makes it to my cup. Can you mix champagne and sake? Not in the same glass of course. I found the sake made my palette more sensitive. So when I went back to champagne, 
I saw a totally new side of it. Such a bonus! Coming shortly after is 
grilled seabass with citrus. It’s so delicious that Henry is moved to tears. I reach out with a bit of support. Our final appetiser is 
chawanmushi with herring roe. This looks like soup but 
it’s actually steamed egg. It’s umami-rich and the texture is luxurious. Appetisers done. Now it’s time for nigiri. balls of rice topped with raw fish. Our first one is Iwashi, or Japanese sardine. Sugita-san is so elegant. He has rhythm like he is dancing and every move he makes 
seems to be in slow motion. As you can see, we are eating 
nigiri the traditional way with our hands. When it hits my plate I reach confidently… And I fumble it. Shit. I hope Sugita-san didn’t see! Although the presentation was ruined, the 
nigiri itself was still absolutely perfect. Warm tangy rice and the most tender, delicious 
fish you ever tasted, with a hint of saltiness. This is a fascinating world, but 
there are many things I don’t know. Like what exactly this is. Or this. And I can’t really describe 
what is happening on my tongue. So I silently respect the depth of this cuisine to which I can no longer see. What I do know is that each of 
these is gorgeous in many ways. The delicate flavors, the elegant textures, the careful presentation will be 
seared into my memory for life. It’s as close to tradition 
and perfection as you can get. The fact that this sushi has been made exactly 
this way for over 200 years is really special. Every move, every cut has been 
passed down for generations. Here I can connect with it through the food. On a personal level, this is important. I was also lucky to share 
the table with an expert. Henry not only translated but 
filled in the knowledge gaps. Making it a history lesson 
and food experience in one. I loved unlocking a new side of champagne 
using the sake to loosen up my tastebuds. It was great fun to experiment 
with these two magical potions. In this traditional, quiet place, 
I actually had a lot of fun. At times I felt like a fish out of water, 
but still I was very comfortable here. Maybe because I knew I was in such good hands. The result was a wonderful experience. And memories I will treasure for years."

You have our restaurant for today DiverXO Welcome to Madrid.  Known for it’s rich traditions, 
party nightlife and football fever. In the city’s north end you’ll find 
the NH Collection Eurobuilding hotel. Inside is DiverXO. The Chef responsible for this wild 
and crazy place is Dabiz Munoz. Born in Madrid in 1980. He was inspired to become a chef after his first 
fine dining experience totally rocked his world. He was just 12 years old, and from that 
point on, Dabiz was fascinated with cooking. After culinary school, he ended 
up in London and for 6 years,   worked at top Asian restaurants 
like Nobu and Hakkasan. It was here he had a big, bold idea. Open a restaurant with groundbreaking 
cuisine where anything is possible. He calls it DiverXO. Spanish for ‘diverse’ with the XO coming from the famous XO 
sauce from Hong Kong that Dabis loves. It opens in 2007. and in 2013 becomes the first 3 
michelin star restaurant in Madrid. Ten years later DiverXO is still 
the only 3 star in the city. and on World’s 50 Best Restaurant 
list, they sit at number three. In 2019, Chef Munoz adds sommelier 
Miguel Ángel Millán to the team.  In 2023, he won the Beronia 
World’s Best Sommelier award. In 2021, Dabiz was named Best Chef 
at the Worlds Best Chef awards. He took the title again last year. From the outside, the building doesn’t scream 
fine dining, and that’s kinda what we expect. We find the revolving door and make 
our way into the Diverxo dimension. First impression? It’s bold. It’s bonkers. and it’s f***ing brilliant. We are welcomed to our table by two gentlemen, two ants and a waving pig with 
a mohawk and spiked caller. The mood is set to light and playful. You can’t see it, but I’m smiling from ear to ear. Kitsch, creative and courageous is how I would describe the interior. The punk mentality is in full force. The tables are really nice, but 
everything else has a grunge feel. The clothes of the staff are 
as extravagant as the place. The dining spaces are separated 
by floor-to-ceiling curtains that put you in your own area with lots of room. The champagne list is in a league of its own. They have almost anything you could want. Some heavy hitters like Dom Perignon P3. Some rare veterans like a 61 Compte de Champagne. We start with a glass of Krug from 2006. There is only one option on the menu. It’s a tasting menu is called 
The Flying Pig’s Cuisine. It’s described as a journey 
through the hedonistic,   greedy and creative world of Dabiz Muñoz. It’s avant-garde cuisine where 
everything is possible for 365 euros. There are two wine pairings to choose from. The Wine Pairing Selection for 300 euros and the High Flights Wine Pairing for 600. Here I need to come clean. I went to Diverxo with a friend who 
is also a good friend of the chef. So they didn't let us pay for this experience. I know that nobody around the Christmas tree 
is completely honest after they open a gift, but I will try to be objective 
and give my honest opinion. Our first appetiser is called Wok on Coals a Veggie Rollercoaster It’s spinach glazed and wok toasted on hot coals with burrata, kale, watercress 
and sorrel with sansho pepper. On the side is organic Riofrio caviar. It’s finished with a floral cream sauce. At first bite, I’m hit with a flood 
of flavors, textures and temperatures. Impressive first dish. They bring out the wok to show us, how it's done. Sommelier Miguel pairs it with a high 
quality Chenin Blanc with tons of acidity. Before our next course, we are 
invited to try a special sake available exclusively through DiverXO. It's Junmai Daiginjo, the highest grade of sake. It has notes of cotton candy 
and melon and it’s super smooth. Our next course is called Spicy Pizza Margarita It’s frozen mozzarella from goat’s milk drizzled with a sour and spicy consomme of 
tomatoes, aged sherry vinegar and thai basil. It’s acidic, cold, crunchy and pure genius. I love this added touch of 
service here at DiverXO. Before every dish they give you a 
card with all the ingredients listed. Our next dish is called “Raw sweet chili sauce” First we have sweet and sour prawns from Spain. The heads are fried and the bodies are raw. In the syringe is a Melipona honey from Mexico. Melipona are a stingless type 
of bee with a unique honey that has been used for centuries 
for it’s healing properties. The prawns are fresh and fatty 
with a nice chili flavor. Together they are sensational. The wine pairing is a French Reisling 
known for its elegance and lightness. Next is something called 
Street food XO in two parts. The first is Yaki-xo-ba, made with 
espardenas instead of noodles. It’s prepared with homemade soya 
sauce with quail juices and ginger. The second part is quail tataki, 
sea urchin and Lily bulb. The sea urchin and the quail 
go surprisingly well together. The soya sauce and ginger 
make the flavors stand out. All I can say is I really like it. Miguel nails the wine pairing 
with a Spainsh palomino wine. It’s intense and outstanding. Next, another Street Food XO. It’s served with french fries and 
spicy ketchup from tree tomatoes,   goat’s milk butter bearnesa and karashi mustard. Again, the creativity is a 10 out of 10. Flavorwise, it’s leaning towards sweet 
with strong umami and a hint of spiciness. With it is a vintage 1992 
Champagne Fleury Extra Brut. Next is Crab with XO kimchi. It’s blue crab in palm sugar and rice 
vinegar brine, toasted shell oil, homemade iced kimchi and tomalley 
emulsion with barbecue strawberries. The delicate seafood flavor is offset 
nicely with sweet, smokey and nutty flavors. With it comes a 2008 riesling from 
German producer Dr. Burklin-Wolf. Our next course is called Tortiyaki It’s a fusion of Spanish 
tortilla and Japanese takoyaki. Inside is veggie broth made 
from cabbage and spinach. Because of the liquid inside they 
recommend eating it in one bite. It’s paired with a 2016 rioja 
blend red wine from Spain. Another excellent choice by sommelier Miguel. The courses just keep on coming. The next one is called XO Sauce Iberian Version On the left is dried scallop 
and shao long bao dumpling on the right is essence of red prawn which is 
the head of the prawn cooked for one minute. On the spoon we have Jinhua ham with 
shallots, garlic and plankton powder. The wine pairing is a vintage 
Chateau Chalon from 1982. At this point, it’s time for a pit stop. To get to the toilet, I’m told 
to ‘follow the butterflies’ I love the creativity. Our next course is a crispy 
Iberian suckling pig sandwich. It’s a cold cut from the head of 
suckling pig with Pecorino cheese, cured goose yolk and homemade sriracha. It’s complimented with peppercorns 
and black chanterelle pesto sauce. I love the juicy, tender pork 
with the sharp pecorino cheese. It’s paired with a 2013 La 
Muse from from California. It’s a dense, juicy red that is 
a perfect match for this dish. Our next creation is called 45 Day Aged Nigiri and Pyrenean Ecosystem Another complex dish with a 
remarkable range of textures featuring ingredients and 
techniques from all over the world. The wine with this dish is a 2014 Sori San Lorenzo   from Gaja - one of Italy’s 
most famous wine producers. I can’t get enough of the decor. I’m a big fan of Salvador 
Dali and I think Dabiz is too. After all, the famous artist was from Spain and even attended art school here in Madrid. Our next dish is warm sashimi 
with upside down fried baby eels, Clams Valoute “Al Riesling”, Enoki 
Mushrooms and Grilled “Sepieta” The baby eels have been frozen at 
minus forty degrees for one minute,   creating a unique taste and texture. There is a beautiful umami 
flavor in the clam sauce. This is a top contender. Our wine this time is a Sorte Antiga 
from Spanish producer Rafael Palacios. We are over half finished this menu, and 
at this point I have run out of words It's a very powerful experience. Next is a dish called Duck Variety. We have duck foie, grilled and rested Crispy flame-grilled tongue
and brains marinated in duck juice I never knew duck brain tasted so good. It’s super fatty and full of herb and spice. The pairing is a 2016 from Luis Perez. This Spanish sherry wine is sweet and 
acidic and would be great on its own. Our next course is TOURNEDÓ ROSSINI OF RED 
BREAM WITH SAKE AND SHIRAKO. Tournedos Rossini is a French dish 
that combines steak with foie gras. Here at DiverXO they reimagine it using only fish. It’s roasted red bream aged for two days 
in sake, in a spicy red wine lemon sauce and topped with slightly roasted shirako. On the side is cappuccino 
flowers dressed with beurre blanc Shirako is a delicacy from Japan which 
is the male counterpart of caviar. That’s right. Fish semen. Its hand-harvested from all types 
of fish and other sea creatures. But it’s not just an Asian thing. In the rest of the world, it’s known as fish milt. Besides fine dining, it’s 
common in Italy and Russia. It’s paired with a wine that is another big one - a 1994 Corton Charlemagne grand cru. This chardonnay from the famous Burgundy 
region is well-regarded and highly rated. This next course is called The Ages of Hake First we have 3 month old hake with head and bones Then it’s 1 year old hake with yellow aji And finally 8 year old Hake with emulsion 
of the fish head with tahiti lime dressing. The creativity goes to new heights here. Same type of fish, three totally 
different flavors and textures. The wine pairing was a syrah from 2009. Just when you thought the chef 
was out of creativity comes  Mos Rooster Stew. It’s rooster drumsticks, thighs 
and comb in yellow mole tree chile. With colunga faba beans in a 
beurre blanc of it’s own emulsion Then we have a corn taco with 
chard and squash blossoms. It comes with a vintage Imperial 
gran reserva cosecha from 1976 Coming into the home stretch we have Blonde Beef, penja pepper and 
mushrooms served on a steer horn. It’s tender, juicy, succulent and packed 
with sour, spicy and umami flavor. The wine is a 2016 Clos de Vougeot Grand cru. Our first dessert is a wine from way back. Its a 1955 from Sainte Croix de Mont 
in the southern part of Bordeaux. This producer Brun has been making 
wine here for 6 generations. Our next dessert is called vanilla cauliflower It’s sour greek yoghurt and cured egg 
yolk with peruvian chuncho chocolate. It’s a decadent rollercoaster of sweet and 
sour flavors with crunchy and smooth textures. The pairing is a Tokaji Aszú sweet wine from 1972. This famous Hungarian wine is still 
made with century old technology and was said to be a favorite of Thomas 
Jefferson and King Louis the fourteenth. It’s kinf of funny that I’m from Hungary,   yet I had to travel to Madrid to taste 
the oldest Hungarian wine of my life. That brings us to the final wine pairing. A 2002 riesling from the 
famous Mosel region of Germany. This completes the holy trinity of sweet wines - France, Hungary and now Germany. The riesling is paired with 
our final course for today: Toasted butter risotto It’s made with truffle, madeira wine 
spaghetti and black olive cookies. It’s a delicious swan song 
to the DiverXO experience. As a last goodbye we have the petit fours. Cheesecake, a traditional violet 
bon bon and cookies dunked in milk. Nice nostalgic touch at the very end. What can I say about DiverXO? My mind is officially blown. In so many ways, this is different of 
what we are used to on this channel. The punk theme is beautiful in its 
imperfection, especially the rustic elements. I love the diverse mix of ingredients,   the funky creations and different 
serving methods from all over the world. It makes it less of a meal and more 
of an ambitious food adventure. One special part of my DiverXO 
experience has to be the wine pairing. I felt like a time traveler, 
stepping back through history. This pairing is one of the best I've ever had. The DiverXO experience has pushed 
the boundaries from start to finish. Proving nothing is impossible and with enough 
dedication and hard work, pigs CAN fly. Before we go, we get some 
face time with Chef Dabis. He tells us his plans to extend 
the DiverXO experience to include   a lounge in a new two thousand square foot space. He admits it’s hard to find the 
balance between family and business but the best is yet to come, and whatever happens, he assures us - it will NOT be boring."

So strap in. But don’t forget your sunglasses. Because we are about to get Ultraviolet. The master chef behind it is Paul Pairet. His fine dining career led him to Istanbul, Hong 
Kong, Sydney, Jakarta and finally to Shanghai where Pairet launches a concept he 
had been working on nearly 20 years. It’s the first restaurant of its kind to 
unite food with multi-sensory technology and create a fully immersive dining experience. He calles it Ultraviolet. It takes the Worlds 50 Best 
Restaurants list by storm, and Time magazine calls it one 
of the world’s greatest places. In 2017, it gets three 
stars in the Michelin guide. With all the secrecy and awards, 
I had to see it for myself. The Ultraviolet experience 
begins at the riverside. With a meeting at one of Chef 
Pairet’s other restaurants, Mr and Mrs Bund. We are welcomed warmly and 
shown to a table for 10. Here we wait for our fellow Ultraviolet diners. Chef Pairet opened it in 2009. It’s a French bistro with a 
new spin on classic cuisine. It becomes the first restaurant in mainland 
China on the Worlds 50 Best Restaurants list. Welcome drinks are served. This is a Cuvee Reserve Cider 
from Famille Dupont in France. Very nice. Then we are invited to step outside. Are we starting? No. They just want to show us the 
post-card view of the Pudong district. I ask the staff if I can film, and they agree. But they kindly ask not to spoil 
all the surprise for future guests. I promise to do my best. After a few minutes, we are back 
at the table for our first bite. It’s one bite onion soup with gruyere crunch,   parmesan cheese, caramelized 
onion and black truffle. The first bite and I’m already having fun. The soup is nothing short of amazing. We receive the menu in the most unusual way. As I am coming to my senses, we are told. It’s time to go. We are ushered out on to the 
street and into a minibus. On board, our guides keep us laughing by telling 
us the driver just got his license that day. We have no idea where they are taking us. With every turn, the excitement grows. A video on board does a great job 
of making us even more curious. After 15 minutes, just as the ride 
is starting to get bumpy, we arrive. To an underground parking garage 
in a dirty industrial area. This is a three Michelin star restaurant? One of Time’s greatest places in the world?! It's all just misdirection. And then all is quiet. Any second now, we should… We are shown to the dining room. There are no chandeliers or columns here. This place is a tech junkies dream. LED panels cover the walls and ceiling. Projectors and speakers point everywhere and
mounted in the ceiling are cameras. The staff keeps an eye on each diner to deliver 
customized service with ultra precision. Today we will be trying the UVC+ menu. It’s a tasting menu with 20 courses in 4 acts. To keep my word with the management, I can’t show you everything. But I will show you one course from each act. And now, let the show begin. Our first course opens with fiery intensity. Inside is fresh abalone. This course is more than just food. Abalone shells are said to 
be a sacred symbol of the sea that can bring guidance and calm emotions. The soundtrack for this course 
comes from the Ghost in the Shell. It’s a classic Japanese anime from the 90s that 
focuses on self-identity in a high tech world. The abalone is served with yuzu caramel, 
dill oil and lime topped with leek ash. It has a unique taste like a 
combination of seafood and chicken. The fire gives it a smoky flavor but 
the dill and lime really punch through. This course is paired with a 2009 
premiere cru Extra Brut champagne. It’s low in sweetness, high in acidity 
and has an aroma of spices and fruit. I love to see champagne in the wine pairing. Our second act is called The Land. I want to show you our 6th course. It’s called Mushrooms. We are joined by two hardworking 
tableside chefs in uniform. Who help us discover 5 mushrooms 
with 5 unique textures. We have charred Paris and Shitake Mushrooms, 
Mushroom Jelly, lemon pepper cream, Mushroom meringue, dry Mushroom 
leather and Golden Thread Mushroom. The night scene really narrows our senses 
to focus on the texture of the food. Which ranges from spongy to meaty. I can’t get enough of this camping theme. For this course, Ultraviolet 
earns the badge for creativity. This course is paired with a young 
Corton Charlemagne Grand Cru. The scene takes us to the river side in Singapore. The doors open. And we are transported to a lively hawker stall. The servers are in character as workers 
at a traditional streetfood restaurant. Blasting from the speakers is a 
famous Mandopop song from the 80’s. The title is “A Goose in the Sky” It all fits seamlessly with what’s coming. Singapore black pepper beef and Beijing Cola duck. The first is a twist of the traditional 
Singaporian classic - black pepper crab. Here they use beef. It’s smoked Wagyu beef sirlon with black pepper 
sauce served with jasmine rice and butter lettuce. This wagyu is phenomenal. It’s beautifully tender with gorgeous marbling. The wine pairing is a 2016 Corton Clos du 
Roi grand cru from French producer Montille. It’s a highly rated, elegant pinot 
noir that pairs well with red meat. And now, our final act.
Dessert Feast your senses on our 16th course. Lunar Mushroom. The soundtrack is Fly Me too 
the Moon by Frank Sinatra. Soon everyone is singing along. The choreography is absolutely breathtaking. This is the most creative presentation yet. This dessert is mushroom bamboo fungus. Notice how the pattern and 
the shadow of the fungus, looks like the surface of the moon. It’s freeze dried with vanilla syrup, 
seasoned with hazelnut oil and nutmeg, and injected with Yakult, orange 
blossom and Grand Marnier sorbet. It’s topped with dried bamboo fungus. It’s light but crunchy and absolutely delicious. As the meal ends they roll the credits. Giving kudos to the whole production team. What I’ve shown you today, is 
just the tip of the iceberg. There were 16 courses we didn’t show you. To get a closer look, you will have to visit. It will set you back around twelve 
hundred euros for two people. Ultraviolet is unique, as you have seen. It’s theater with food. It’s a show. Every move is choreographed 
and beyond your control. There is no time to get to know the servers 
or have a discussion about champagne. It’s just not that kind of place. It’s a ride. Like a rollercoaster - just get on, and experience it. There were times when I just wanted 
to shut it all off for a minute, to have some time to focus 
on these amazing dishes. Sometimes they felt like felt like 
side characters, in this performance. But overall, it was a great experience. Full of surprises and laughs. Touches of nostalgia.
and elements of mystery. For a moving and unforgettable 
fine dining experience. Put Ultraviolet on your list."

UNBELIEVABLE lunch at this 3 MICHELIN STAR restaurant (€295) - Boury,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53iAu9_wsvI,"#3michelinstar #michelinstarchef #belgium

When you think of Belgium, what’s the first thing that comes to mind?
Let me guess: Waffles? Chocolate? or beer?
We know them for these things, but as you’re about to find out, there is so much more to food here in Belgium.

Join us at a restaurant called Boury. It’s located in Roeselare, Belgium.
The owner and executive chef is Tim Boury. Soon after opening Boury, the awards came flooding in. Within a year, they had the first michelin star.
In 2017, they received their second Michelin star, and in 2022, they added a cherry on top - the third and final Michelin star.

For number eleven, let’s go somewhere exotic. How about…China? Welcome to the world’s 3rd largest city Shanghai. Population 28 million. It was one of the first Chinese ports opened
to Western trade. and today it handles more than 47 million
containers per year. It’s the busiest port in the world. You might know Shanghai for its skyline. This is the Pudong district with three famous
landmarks. The city has more than a 100.000 restaurants. and today we will try one of them. Let’s go to Taian Table. It’s the creation of Stefan Stiller. It doesn’t sound Chinese, does it? That’s because he was born in Celle, Germany
in 1966. After mandatory military service, Stiller bounced from one michelin star restaurant
to the next. Eventually landing in Deidesheim in 1988 where he became chef-de-cuisine at
Restaurant Schwarzer Hahn. While working there, he noticed a vacant building
across the street. Stiller bought the property and one year later, opened his own fine dining restaurant. He called it Restaurant Grand Cru and after 8 months, he received his first
Michelin star. He moved his family to Shanghai. Ever since, he has been a presence in th city’s
culinary scene as a chef, entrepreneur and mentor to aspiring cooks
in China. He opened Taian Table in 2016. Within 5 months, they had the first Michelin
star. In 2019 the second. And in 2021, the third and in 2022, the Michelin guide added the
green star. Aside from Taian Table Shanghai, Stiller also
has Taian Table Guangzhou. It opened in 2021 and was awarded 2 Michelin
stars the same year. On top of all this, Chef Stiller operates
a cooking school, catering business, and he is the president of the Bocuse d’Or
Team in China. We are here in the heart of Shanghai in the
Changning district. Taian Table is hidden in a residential area
not far from office buildings and business parks. A great location for a 3 Michelin star restaurant. Inside we are seated at a wrap-around table
for 20 guests. Everyone has a front row seat facing the kitchen
and prep area. The interior feels a little industrial. This is not a typical European 3 star, where you have silver, gold 
and porcelain everywhere. Still, everything feels quality, and mostly
because of the workers behind it. The kitchen seems a bit crowded like a beehave, especially considering that Stiller is German. But it’s a theater for the guests, so I’m totally here for it. The show begins with a visit 
from Chef Stiller himself. We enjoy a glass of his signature champagne
as he explains his philosophy. He cooks refined, modern and creative cuisine with techniques rooted in Europe 
and inspired by local ingredients. We discuss the menu. It changes every six weeks, 
which is a huge undertaking. Today we will try menu number 41. It’s a mandatory 8-course tasting menu that
captures the spirit and energy of the season. On top of that, you can customize your experience  and extra dishes from their 
classics and specials menu. Chef Stiller recommends the sea urchin from
the classics menu. It’s a fan favorite. Once, he took it off the menu, 
and so many people complained, he had to put it back on. I’m sold. He also recommends the scallops and the caviar. It’s tough to choose so we go with both. The price for the fixed menu with two classic
dishes converts to 330 euro. Next, we need some wine. I go for vintage champagne. 1996 Femme de Champagne from 
Duval Leroy for 815 euro. This is a Prestige cuvee. It’s the finest level of 
champagne a producer makes. The 1996 vintage means only the best wines
from that year were selected. This wine is exclusive to Taian Table. It’s the only restaurant in China that has it. Our first bites are parmesan crackers, seaweed
crackers and spiced macadamia nuts. We are also served a welcome tea of jasmine
and fermented plum. Next is a snack inspired by the Indian street
food Pani Puri. It’s usually filled with chickpea, potato
or onion. Here, they put their own spin on it, adding papaya, mango, pine nuts and masala. It’s sweet, sour, spicy and 
surprisingly refreshing. Our amuse bouche is presented on three levels
and we are told to go from lowest to highest. First we have a rice cracker with mimolette
cheese aged for 12 months with grilled peas and mint. Then, a hollow sunchoke chip filled with it’s
own puree, mushrooms and pine nuts. Finally a seaweed chip with 
tuna tartar and caviar. Our last snack before the main show is sourdough
croutons with chicken jus and freshly grated Australian black truffle. The flavors in everything so far have been
stunning. I’m really enjoying this place. It has a great vibe, partly because of the music. Like the menu, the music changes with the season. Chef Stiller makes each playlist personally and even puts them on Spotify. He is super approachable and easy to talk to. As chill as a 3 michelin star chef can get. Sipping champagne and overseeing the service. I’m loving the champagne too. At this point my Duval Leroy is opening up and only getting better and better. The show begins with our first tasting course. We have green asparagus cooked 
sous vide with 3 emulsions. The yellow is an egg yolk sauce The green is chive and the 
black one is black garlic Then we have a marinated hamachi from Japan with slightly fermented 
asparagus slices around it. Inside is 5J ham and citrus jelly. The sauce is made with fermented asparagus
and yogurt. I love the creativity of this dish and it’s
almost a crime to destroy it. There is so much work into it plus these tiny
details make it a joy to look at. The asparagus was excellent and allowed some
of the sweetness to come through. But it was the three emulsions that really
made it pop. The combination of rich and creamy, floral
and earthy flavors really get your attention. You can see the work the young sous chef puts
into this. The hamachi was all about layering textures
that almost melt in your mouth. Our next dish are from the classics menu. Scallop and Caviar. The scallops are from Hokkaido, Japan. They are prepared with a celery tartar 
and a scoop of beurre blanc ice cream topped with caviar oscietra no. 4. Ice cream seems like a question mark but it totally works. It puts some cool sweetness into the saltiness
of the caviar and scallops. The caviar dish brings us a generous helping
of caviar oscietra no. 2 with beetroot, edible 
flowers and ajo blanco sauce. Our server encourages us to make a little mess. That’s they only way to enjoy it. The caviar is excellent on its own but this almond garlic sauce 
manages to transform it  into something spectacular. Our next dish was Otoro tuna, Thai pomelo,
cashew and caviar in a kombucha sauce. Tubtim Siam Pomelo is a soft and sweet fruit
and grows only in southern Thailand. People pay a premium and often give it as a gift because they believe that this 
fruit brings luck and wealth. Sweetness is the overwhelming flavour, followe by a hint of sourness on the tongue. In this dish, the sauce was super powerful and pushed my taste buds to the limit. I liked the flavors but couldn’t finish it. Next is the famous sea urchin dish that Chef Stiller can’t take off the menu. I totally understand why. It’s a slice of sourdough 
bread dipped in brown butter,  balsamic vinegar and soy sauce. Then, a layer of oyster mayo 
emulsified with a bit of grapeseed oil. On top is fresh sea urchin 
and slice of green apple. Umami from the sea urchin, tartness from the apple and the smokiness of the toast gave
this a a depth of flavors. It’s explosive with every bite. Chef Stiller invites us to try a special German
riesling. It’s from the same area as his first restaurant. It’s a beautiful wine. Next is Grilled Oyster Regal No. 1 It’s starts with smoked katsuobushi, then a marinated and grilled oyster topped
with oyster foam and powder. On the side is a salad made of cucumbers,
celery and lemon This was such a delight. It seemed to have all the flavors present. From smokey to briney to fresh and citrusy, there was something for every 
flavor center on the tongue. At one point, we were drinking our Duval Leroy
1996 and Stiller was drinking a 2006 Cristal. We decided to compare the two. We offered him a taste of 
ours and he did the same. I found the Cristal to be crisp and vibrant. But with it’s richness and complexity, the
more mature Duval Leroy destroyed it   hands
down. Despite his age, the Leroy felt younger. It was fun to compare these two titans of
wine. At the half way point we have grilled King
Crab Leg with white miso hollandaise and pickled watermelon radish. Chef Stiller recommended to take a piece of crab, dip it in the sauce and take a small
piece of radish. The crab is smoky and succulent while the white miso hollandaise 
sauce gives it some tangy flavors. The pickled watermelon radish adds a zesty twist. Not my favorite presentation of the evening,
but I enjoyed this one. Our next wine is a chardonnay 
from the Chassange-Montrachet  region from 2020 It’s buttery, gorgeous wine. We keep the seafood going with our next dish. It’s wild Patagonian toothfish, 
also known as Chilean sea bass. On the bottom we have okinawa 
spinach in a bouillabaisse sauce, which is a traditional French seafood soup, finished with a carpaccio made of zucchini. From the spinach we have a slightly earthy
taste, while the savory bouillabaisse 
sauce gave it acidity. The fish itself was soft and buttery. Perfection. Our next course draws inspiration from India. On the bottom we have a smoked lentil stew then foie gras topped with crumble of pistachio,
lentils and rice everything sits in a vadouvan curry from Tamilnadu on top there are three different textures of plum. So many flavors here - savory, 
nutty, spicy, and fruity. Next is a palette cleanser It’s greek yogurt, salad and a sorbet of apple
and cucumber juice with Monkey 47 gin. In the mortar we have fennel 
pollen and mint leaves along with liquid nitrogen that freezes
the oils and flavors locking them in. I love the dramatic tableside theater. The dish is great too. The range of cold temperatures was intense
and energizing. Our main course is Pork in 
3 ways from 3 countries. It can be difficult to find 
good quality pork in China, so they usually need to bring it in. On the bigger plate we have 
pork tenderloin from Canada, slow cooked, seared in burnt leek soup. It’s exceptional. Then we have suckling pig with spring vegetables,
bell peppers and artichoke. This is a specialty from the Guangdong region
of China. It was tasty but I found it a bit dry. Finally we have Iberico pork from Spain. It’s a spare rib marinated and 
grilled in a sourdough crisp. This one I liked the most. The dish was delightful. It had a crispy texture and outstanding taste. With this course we have a German pinot noir
from 2014. When you think ‘pinot noir’ you probably
don’t think Germany, but this wine is something else. It has a nose of ripe fruit with cherry 
and dark chocolate on the palette. And a beautifully long finish. Our dessert is umeboshi from Japan Served with merange cookie with 
matcha powder and dried strawberry Umeboshi is also known as salted Japanese plum. It’s salty and sour, but in this dessert its offset 
by the pure sweetness of  the cookie. It’s a unique dessert with enormous flavor. With it comes a champagne liqueur from Solera. It’s a sweet 'Ratafia' wine made from 
Chardonnay and Pinot Noir grapes. It has layers of fruit and spice 
and a long lingering finish. More dessert. This is roasted rice gelato with avocado and 
frozen mango finished with a sesame chip. It’s quite sweet with some 
savory elements to balance it. The presentation is playful. I like it. Our final dessert is toasted brioche with a layer of white chocolate,
sous vide cooked pineapple, foam of pina colada, sorbet of coconut
and topped with herbs and a coconut crisp A work of art both in presentation and taste. The Petit fours signal the end of the meal
is fast approaching. First is Pava which is saltine and peach strudel The smiley face is a passion 
fruit mousse with coconut tart The cherry is chocolate mousse 
cake with cherry liqueur And finally the classic canele Each one had unique levels of sweet, tart
and bitter. This is a great effort by the pastry team. Then we have a farewell from the chef We have chocolate with amaretto And inside the lego man is watermelon jelly. The Lego is a clever touch. I love how they tap into our childhood to
bring back memories. We are not quite done. Last we are given a selection of bon bons. Each one is special in its own way. There is white chocolate, beetroot, 
mojito, rosemary apricot and yuzu. I witnessed a really nice moment with Chef
Stiller and his team. They were celebrating two anniversaries. Sous chef Christiaan Stoop was 
celebrating one year with the company and Director of Operations 
Tedd Park was celebrating two. A good leader has strong followers. I have great respect for these people who 
are focused and dedicated to their work. You know I always find a 
reason to buy a bottle of Krug. But here I was more than happy 
to join their celebration. Because I was amazed by these people, and the fabulous work that they provide that day. The total for two of us is just over 2000 euro. After the meal, we talk with Chef Stiller
some more. He said in Asia, most European chefs bend  to local tastes and tone 
down the salt and acidity. But not Chef Stiller. He does his thing and if people like it, they
come back. Not to say the environment hasn’t had an
effect on him. In many ways Chef Stiller is like a zen master. He has a calm and gentle way about him. No doubt this has helped him earn the success
he enjoys today. Over a Yamazaki whiskey he tells us the words
he lives by. He says you don’t always have to represent
your country or your local kitchen. The goal should be to innovate and do something
different, not to be 100% perfect. I think we can all use a little bit of his
wisdom. As chef Stiller says
Innovation before perfection."

Dining at Norway’s NO.1 Restaurant (€389) - Maaemo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ql-5UptQ2k,"Welcome to Norway. Our restaurant for today is Maaemo. It's located in Oslo and the head chef is Esben Holmboe Bang. 
The restaurant works in the New Nordic Cuisine genre, and focuses on local food and only uses organic, biodynamic, or wild produce..
The restaurant was one of the first Nordic restaurant to be awarded 2 stars in the Michelin guide in February 2016. In December 2019, the restaurant closed to move to another location. This resulted in the loss of all of its three Michelin stars in February 2020. In September 2021 Maaemo won back the three stars.

I found an EXTREME RESTAURANT in the Norwegian fjords - Iris Restaurant,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh1iVEDisD0,"Iris is a unique restaurant located inside a floating orb called Salmon Eye in Hardangerfjord, Norway.
It’s the world’s largest floating art installation. The scenery is absolutely breathtaking of course,
but something keeps popping up in my mind. That film from 2022. The Menu.

Head Chef Anika Madsen has a passion for discovering ingredients from the ocean and a deep commitment to sustainability.

It all started with a restaurant recommendation. The next thing I know, I’m on this boat. On this fjord. Here in Norway. The scenery is absolutely breathtaking of course, but something keeps popping up in my mind. That film from 2022. The Menu. That is our destination floating in the distance. But first, we are told, a little stop over to get to know each other. On a sparsely populated island. The soft meditation music in the background 
tells me that my experience is beginning. It opens with a drink. This is a cider from a company called Edel. It was such a hit they made a business out of it. I don’t drink cider too 
often, but this is incredible. Our first snack honors nature’s diversity. It’s a cone filled with vegetables, 
herbs and a citrus emulsion. It’s light and crispy and very appetising. Our second snack is a tribute to 
an old Scandinavian tradition. It’s grilled brioche topped with 
a cream made from smoked cod roe and grated scallop roe. The apple cider really 
balances the smoky sea flavors. Excellent pairing. This has been great, but now it’s 
finally time for the main event. First some introductions. This is Nico from Denmark. He is the front of house specialist 
responsible for the service side of things. Nico’s wife is Anika Madsen. She is the head chef. Her first head chef role was at 
Roxie in the 5 star hotel Herman K. Then in 2020, Anika moved to the 
restaurant Fasangarden in Copenhagen. Here she has the freedom to 
create a menu led by sustainable, seasonal ingredients from 
local farmers and fishermen. It’s a concept she falls in love with. A few years later she has the 
opportunity to do the same thing here in the middle of nature. She jumps at the chance. Now, Nico and Anika live here, on this 
island with 5 other restaurant staff. There are no road connections 
and it’s only accessible by boat. This group seems committed, that’s for sure. But then again, they’ve only 
been open a very short while. Today is their 3rd day of business. Ever. So we are back on the boat. The closer we get to this strange 
building, the more curious I get. It was finished in 2022 as an exhibition 
center for the Norwegian aquaculture industry. It’s 25 meters long and weighs 
more than twelve hundred tons. More than 9000 steel plates 
cover it like fish scales. It’s the world’s largest 
floating art installation. and home to our restaurant for today. Iris. We arrive to the same comforting 
music we heard at the boathouse. It’s slow and melodic, creating 
a calm, peaceful space. That movie, The Menu, comes 
rushing back as the door closes. Suddenly, we are in complete darkness. No one says a word. What’s going on? I see things hanging down from the ceiling, but I have no idea what’s happening. Suddenly the video starts playing. And soon, their mission becomes clear to create a sustainable world through 
food in the service of nature. The 18-course menu presents ideas to see 
our biggest food challenges in a new light and focuses on the untapped 
potential of the ocean. it’s time for our next snack 
and our first lesson in ecology. The dish is called Uni-fication, 
with kelp and sea urchin. Sea urchin is an invasive species 
that feeds on kelp forests underwater. By eating more sea urchin, we can help 
the important kelp forests survive. The host asks us to choose a hanging 
kelp cracker to unite with sea urchin. It was salty and acidic with a great crunch. I could eat this any time. Then, a quick view that pinpoints the 
different producers that supply the restaurant.  We are in Hardangerfjord, the 
second longest fjord in Norway.  The suppliers are all from the area.  It’s an amazing system that 
is connected only by water. We are shown to our table. The furniture and table 
settings are really beautiful. Pure Scandinavian quality. The wine list is premium, as you might expect. My I eyes suddenly stuck on an item which 
I wanted to try for a very long time. This was a special Krug clos du mesnil 2008. and I also go with the wine pairing. The first pairing is a 
champagne from Bonnet-Ponson. They are a small producer from Chamery in France who use only organic farming methods. Our first course is called ‘Coat of Arms’ It’s mahogany clams, herb 
emulsion and Norwegian tomatoes. It looks like a flowerbed and I feel a 
bit bad destroying this presentation. The dish is rich and aromatic. Tremendous flavors here. “Feeding Future” It starts with a showpiece 
of 4 sustainable proteins. These will make the cream for our dish. It’s Yeast, insects, mycellium and algae powder. The breaded salmon is a ten out of ten. I have never had this small size of salmon before. Brilliant idea. They use salt bravely here, 
and it’s bloody delicious. “Colorblind” It’s cheviche-style white salmon 
with birch sap and elderflower. I am stunned. This dish was so good. The acidity is incredible. It’s paired with a natural wine 
from the Auverne region of France. This wine is aged the traditional way in amphora and it has really strong notes of elderflower. Well-matched. “Next-level Neighbors”
   It’s nordic blini with fresh shrimp, 
caviar and black currant leaves. I love this dish. There is something special about the shrimp. The cold water fattens them up, and fat means flavour. The caviar wasn’t dominant, 
it was more like a spice. I love this dish It’s paired with another natural French wine. I’m not big fan of these wines 
and I didn’t love this one either. At the half-way point I can 
say the kitchen is strong. They are consistent in exceeding my expectations. The service side has still a room to grow. Everyone is kind and enthusiastic. The service can get clumsy at times. And this means small things get overlooked. There is a lot of weight on the service team. I think with time they will grow 
to the level of the kitchen. Let’s not forget this is 
only their third day open! And what a challenge it must be to find 
people to work here in the far far away. “From zero to hero” It showcases two heroes found in nature. The first is lumpsucker. It’s a fish that cleans salmon. The second is oyster mushroom. It can clean up oil spills. In this dish they meet with buerre 
blanc, pointed cabbage and new peas. Very strong acid profile and good balance I feel the kitchen is really putting on a show. Next, we move to the very comfortable sofas. Our next dish is made of ingredients 
sourced within 500 meters. The idea is to be more aware 
of the food sources available. 70% of the earth is covered with water, but only 2% of our calories come from the ocean. This course is smoked Blue 
Mussels, seaweed and beach crab. The plate is very interesting. and then VOILA The light comes on. Beautiful. This is an intense and exciting dish. I like the way chef Anika cooks so much. She will win a lot of awards. The pairing is Krug Grande Cuveé. No words needed. We are moving again, this time to the terrace. We arrive to a grill party.
It’s like coming to an old friend. The meat is already cooking on the 
fire, ice cold beer in the bucket… This is something I absolutely didn’t expect. We are told to sit back and relax for 10 minutes. The atmosphere is friendly, the view is stunning, and the weather is beautiful. it’s really easy to do that. For our next course, we try authentic viking food. Grilled flatbread and dried meat. And we have a beer. It’s a Lervig Peach Pilsner that combines 
the crisp beer with a hint of juicy peach. This is a nice moment. Our next course is called Weeds of the Sea. Squid and cuttlefish numbers have 
been going up since the fifties. They are called the weeds of the sea because 
they grow fast and adapt to changes quickly. Here we have thinly sliced Norwegian 
cuttlefish cooked in dashi butter with kelp and unripe strawberries. This plate is beautiful. I know I’m saying it over and over 
but this is very, very strong. The depth of flavor, the technical skill, this is perfect. The pairing is from Alexandre Bain It’s a natural white wine with 
mineral, fruity and salty notes. Our next course is called Change of Heart In this course they open our 
eyes to the world of wild game as a way to fight climate change. Did you know that reindeer and roebuck 
produce C02 levels 50 times lower than beef? This dish features a tartar of reindeer 
heart, grilled leeks and pickled capers. I’m speechless. This chef cooks like very few I’ve seen. Every dish is exciting. Next we choose a blade. The knife maker is a gentlemen in his 70’s who finds wood in the nearby mountains 
and creates knife handles from it. “Horn to hoof” Our main course features reindeer again. The first serving is baked tongue 
topped with shredded reindeer heart. The texture is out of this world. On the plate is reindeer fillet with fresh   raspberries and a sauce of 
pepper and mustard seed.  If I had to name a restaurant where 
I ate significantly better dishes, I couldn’t. It’s paired with an elegant 
pinot noir from Burgundy. It comes from Domaine Remi Jobard. This is an organic wine and all 
of the work is done by hand. Our first sweet course is hazelnut ice cream 
and caviar with spruce shoots and pine. Ice cream sandwich with caviar. Bulls eye. I would never have thought that 
this local thing can be this strong. It’s paired with an IS Sider This is a new trend of making cider 
with the same process as ice wine Lots of sweetness together 
with a fantastic acidity, lots of complex flavours. Very good length and intensity. The cider we had in the boat house was very good, now we got a sweet wine from the same producer Our next sweet course is a tribute to the great 
mountains we can see from the dining room. They are called Malm and Melder. The dish is a rhubarb sorbet 
with salted oat crumble. The green coloring comes from pine. It’s beautifully creative to show the 
topography of the mountains nearby. The flavor is next level too. The ice cider goes even better with this 
dish, the acids come together perfectly. We also learn to speak like a Norwegian. There is a famous saying “Ut på tur, aldri sur” It means Out on a hike, never sour. There are 20,000km of marked trails in Norway and hiking is said to be 
nature’s best stress relief. It’s back to the roof for a disgestif. Chairman’s reserve rum from Saint Lucia We still have one course to go. It’s called Tribute to Rosendal. It’s in honor of their closest neighbor, the town of Rosendal. Population: eight hundred and four. This course is a pate de fruit 
with roses and wild forest berries. It’s super sweet and intense. Last but not least, we have the petit fours. A small rum truffle with 
norwegian rum and bitter cocoa and cake made from roasted almond 
flour, creme fraiche and black currant The bitter balances nicely with the sweet cake. Excellent finish to an amazing dining experience. It’s only a matter of time before this 
place gets the attention of the world. I htink all the lists and awards will be lined up. From the boat trip to the light show to the concept teaching sustainability, this restaurant radiates unbelievable vibes. Add this to a super-strong kitchen. An outstanding audiovisual 
and gastronomic experience. All I can say about Iris is “Oh my god"" and that does it for this episode thank you for joining me if you like this video, hit subscribe see you next time"

I ate a €400 menu at an Asian 3 Michelin Star Restaurant - Zén (Singapore),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SneEz9TFfAw,"#3michelinstar #singapore #zén

In this video, we are going somewhere we’ve never gone before. For the first time ever, we visited an Asian 3 michelin star restaurant. In Singapore, we find our restaurant for today. Zen.

Probably The BEST Restaurant in Italy - Piazza Duomo (Enrico Crippa),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tdrMksmbZ0,"The founder and head chef is Enrico Crippa. 
He opens Piazza Duomo in 2005, and within one year, he has the first Michelin star.
He gets the second in 2009 followed by the third in 2011.

Piazza Duomo is also a regular on the world’s 50 Best Restaurant list.
At the time of shooting this video, they stood at number 19.

In 3 hours, Chef Crippa and Piazza Duomo raised the bar and put on a show, and in my opinion, this is probably the best restaurant in Italy.

Welcome to Paris. Home of the Mona Lisa, the Eiffel Tower and our restaurant for today - Plénitude.
It opened in 2021 and was awarded 3 Michelin stars in it’s first year. The head chef is Arnaud Donckele. Crafting a menu that puts sauce in the spotlight is genius. In French cuisine, sauce plays a major role, but maybe not the attention it should. Chef Donckele gives it that attention. 
I can honestly say my experience at Plenitude was perfect.

Massimo Bottura is truly an icon. 
He’s a TV personality, businessman and humanitarian who is driven to make the world a better place. In 2019, he was named one of the one hundred most influential people in the world. 
But still, he is best-known as the man who turned traditional Italian cuisine upside down. 

Massimo opened Osteria Francescana in 1995. In 2002, he gets his first Michelin star, in 2006 he gets the second, and in 2012, the third. It’s the only Italian restaurant named No. 1 by the Worlds 50 Best Restaurants. And not once, but twice!

Francescana. It’s the only Italian restaurant named number one by the Worlds 50 Best Restaurants. not once but twice! That puts it on the bucket list of foodies
all over the world. In this channel, I take you to some of the
world’smost exclusive 3Michelin-star restaurants. My name is Alexander, I’m the co-owner
of a ONE Michelin star restaurant, and I’m on a mission - to 
find inspiration in gastronomy.  Welcome to Alexander the Guest.
And it’s lights out and away we   go - to
Modena! The center of Italian motorsports.
Home to Maserati, Lamborghini and Ferrari. They say a car is only as good as its driver - and the same is true in gastronomy. And at Osteria Francescana, the man behind
the wheel is none other than Massimo Bottura. Born here in Modena in 1966. Massimo’s love
for cooking started in his grandmother’s kitchen and grew into a burning passion. But this wasn’t always met with open arms. His father didn’t speak to him for 2 years
after he dropped out of law school to follow his dream of opening a restaurant. In the rearview mirror, we can see it was
the right move. Massimo is truly an icon. In 2019, he was named one of the one hundred
most influential people in the world, but still, he is best-known as the man  who turned traditional 
Italian cuisine upside down. Massimo helped save the Italian
cheese industry. In 2012, a major earthquake shook
northern Italy. Three-hundred and sixty thousand wheels of
parmigiano reggiano were badly damaged. To sell this cheese, Massimo created a new
dish and shared the recipe. He asked everyone to buy the damaged cheese
and make the dish in their kitchens. It was a huge hit and all of the parmigiano
reggiano was sold. This move saved the industry and created a
new national dish at the same time. Massimo opened Osteria Francescana in 1995. In 2002, he gets his first Michelin
star, in 06 he gets the second, and in 2012, the third. It was a real challenge to make a booking
here. Reservations are made every quarter and they
sell out in a day, so you can guess how excited I was to get 
the call that two places had opened up. We arrive to Modena’s old town. We find Osteria Francescana. Stepping inside, we can see that
Massimo has another passion besides food. Modern art. We are shown to our table. It’s slightly cramped, in a windowless room. I’m not happy about this, but 
I try to put it behind me. There are only 12 tables here and 
I’m glad to be at one of them. We order the 12-course tasting menu, which
cost €320 without drinks. We start with the amuse bouche. A large number of homemade Italian breadsticks
comes with it. They are called grissini and they were so
good I could barely stop eating them. I had to ask the waiter to take them away! The first course was an oyster mousse presented
in the shell, with crunchy vegetables and tender green peas. It was one of the top 3 dishes of the evening. Another memorable course came out of nowhere. It was made with anchovies. This anchovy dish was so fresh with a nice
flavor balance. Super acidity. Not only did I like it, it really stood out
from the pack. The next course wasn't for me. It was vegetables made to look and taste like
a steak. Although it definitely reminded me of a steak,
a steak it was not. This course just didn’t cut it for me and
was a bit of a yellow flag. They recovered nicely with an amazing dish
called Think Green. It was an ecosystem on a plate showing us
an animal and its environment. White representing the cows and green representing
the grass they eat. The whole thing was gorgeous. It was like a painting with yogurt, asparagus
and herbs. Another clever dish was the spaghetti pomodoro
which had cherry and almond flavors. It was a fun twist on a classic Italian dish. Another cheeky course was called “Oops.” According to the story, Massimo once tripped
with a lemon tart and a new dessert was born! Ours was a redesign with tomato and white
chocolate, which rarely meet on the same plate. At Osteria Francescana, we are coming into
the home stretch. It’s the classic petit fours. These are delicate little cakes. Every restaurant has it’s own style in making
them. Here, they had an amazing truffle macaron, which made the ending of our
meal here really memorable. Of course, everything was served on handcrafted
Gironi porcelain, specially made for Massimo. The glasses were also decorated with the iconic
chef's signature. As for the drinks, the tasting menu had a
surprisingly good wine pairing for €210. It was full of young and fresh 
but really balanced wines  and put the skills of the sommelier to the test. Before the meal we ordered glasses of champagne
and Franciacorta to compare them. Franciacorta is a sparkling wine from the
Lombardy region. made with strict guidelines. Although nothing beats champagne, the Franciacorta
was a strong challenger. and gave it a good run for its money. Let me tell you about the service. After seated, we had a delay of 5-minutes, which is a lot in the 3-michelin star world. Luckily, after that, the service ran nicely. What I love about service in 
general is the human side. Where you feel connected to the people. The service here was great, like an engine,
but it was mechanical and missing some of that personal touch. And now my final thoughts on Osteria Francescana. The design is traditional, which I always
like, but our table in the corner had an impact on the overall experience. The staff. They were on top of things at every turn,
but could use a bit more personal touch. The food. Let me break it into thirds. One-third was amazing. One-third was progressive One-third was good, but not for me. Not every 3-Michelin star restaurant will
blow you away. For me, Osteria Francescana had a really good
race, but didn’t take the checkered flag. After thirty years in this business, Massimo
Bottura continues to run on passion and emotion. I hope this fuel keeps him going for years
to come. You can really feel Massimo’s presence here
in Modena. As I was sipping my last negroni at a local bar,  I was looking at the menu 
card from Osteria Francescana. When the waiter saw it, he pointed and said:
Massimo, the master! Here in Modeno, he certainly holds that title. And that does it for this episode. Thank you for joining me if you like this video, hit the subscribe button  and follow me on instagram for

I tried the 420€ Menu at a 3 Michelin Star Restaurant in Italy - Da Vittorio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=419MkeDRIk8,"I take you to some of the world’s most exclusive 3 Michelin-star restaurants.

Today, we are off to the Lombardy region of Italy, to a restaurant called Da Vittorio.
They offered the seasonal white truffle menu, (white truffle is the most expensive ingredient in the world) where everything is built around this single ingredient. 

This 3 Michelin star restaurant is the perfect example of a welcoming, family-run affair. Elegant without being stuffy and sumptuous without being cold, the restaurant offers its guests a warm and spontaneously friendly welcome.

Eating the 430€ Menu at the WORLD’S NO. 1 RESTAURANT (2022) - Geranium,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2RKdhmpf8A,"#finedining #geranium #michelinstar

Geranium is located in Copenhagen, but not where you might expect a 3-Michelin star restaurant to be. It’s not on the high street, it’s not in a trendy neighbourhood, nor a 5 star hotel. It’s actually in a football stadium!

The genius in the kitchen is head chef Rasmus Kofoed. His name is now undoubtedly synonymous with Scandinavian top gastronomy. The 48-year-old Danish chef is the first and only chef in the world to have stood on the podium of the world's most prestigious cooking competition three times, winning the iconic Bocuse d'Or statuette in bronze (2005), silver (2007) and gold (2011).

The three statues still have a prominent place in the world's best restaurant, Geranium. With 3 Michelin stars, Rasmus Kofoed's restaurant not only entered the gastronomic elite in 2016, but it was also named the world's very best restaurant on the list of The World's 50 Best Restaurants last year.

I have visited the best restaurant in the world. The lesson I learnt? Join me to find out!

The Hottest 3 Michelin Star Restaurant In Marseille - AM Par Alexandre Mazzia (€335),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrRRZxBZGik,"I never imagined that I would have one of the most memorable 3-Michelin-star experiences of my life in a small backstreet of Marseille.

A true culinary artist, Alexandre Mazzia is a master of toppings, techniques, textures and tastes, and his cuisine is a perfect blend of the sophisticated French style with the Congolese vibe. He cooks instinctively and follows his own rules, which is particularly exciting knowing that as a professional basketball player, he has spent half his life within a set of rules and constraints.

AM par Alexandre Mazzia opened in June 2014.
In 2015 it’s awarded it’s first Michelin star.
In 2019 star number two, and in 2021 AM par Alexandre Mazzia wins the top honor of 3 Michelin stars.

Needless to say, our expectations were high, but is it worth traveling all the way to Marseille for this experience? Let’s find out!
